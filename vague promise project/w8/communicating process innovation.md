- first show product innovation that passes low bar
- as i was building five agents and seventeen subagents for desinging my, there were moments where the agents knew something i didn't expect it to know. it has long context window and has developed more implicit knowledge than i thought. given the structural similarity (agent collecting data on angie and to extract patterns, just like angie collected and documented every interaction with you), i'd like to raied a doubt that you might be underestimating how much i know, capable of, contribute to your vision
