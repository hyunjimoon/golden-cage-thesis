## 🔑 Key Messages for Advisors

### For Scott (Strategy - WHY/WHAT)
- **Finding 1**: Movement, not initial positioning, predicts venture growth
- **Finding 2**: Capital-flexibility friction exists but is economically small
- **Contribution**: Descriptive construct theory (Cronin Layer 1)

### For Charlie (Operations - HOW)
- **Method**: LTE framework structures theory building reproducibly
- **System**: Modular writing workflow enables efficient production
- **Quality**: All statistics include effect sizes and robustness checks

## 📝 Updated Tagline

> **"Vagueness preserves options; movement exploits learning; capital forces premature commitment."**

### Why this works better than "measurement"

| Term | Problem | Better Framing |
|:-----|:--------|:---------------|
| "Movement is measurement" | Confusing - in quantum mechanics, measurement causes collapse | Movement is the **response** to market feedback |
| "Vagueness buys superposition" | Too jargon-heavy | "Vagueness preserves options" |
| "Capital forces collapse" | Correct but incomplete | "Capital forces premature commitment" |
