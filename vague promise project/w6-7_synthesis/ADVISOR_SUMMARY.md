**Re**: 7-Week Progress – 2 Products + 2 Processes

Dear Charlie and Scott,

I've consolidated seven weeks of work into a focused framework: **2 product innovations** under a unified theory, enabled by **2 process innovations** following Cronin et al.'s LTE typology.

**Product: Quantum Startup Theory**

Ventures behave like quantum systems—existing in superposition until "measured" by market feedback.

- **Movement Principle** (Layer 1: WHAT): Repositioning determines success. Among 180,860 ventures, movers succeed at 18.1% vs. 7.0% for stayers—a 2.6× advantage. Direction doesn't matter; movement does.

- **Golden Cage Effect** (Layer 2: HOW): Capital constrains flexibility through stakeholder commitments. ρ(A,E) = -0.009 (p < 0.001). Small but significant friction.

**Process: Theory → Workflow Pipeline**

- **Process Theory** (Cronin et al., 2025): Structures contributions by layer. Paper M answers "WHAT patterns exist?" (Layer 1). Paper C answers "HOW does capital constrain?" (Layer 2). Layer 3 (WHY mechanisms work) remains for future computational modeling.

- **Writing Workflow**: Operationalizes Process Theory into modular files (s1-s4 per paper), shared interfaces (_shared/notation.md), dashboards (toc.md), and PR-based documentation.

**The Connection**: Process Theory defines the *layer structure* (WHAT→HOW→WHY); Writing Workflow implements each layer as *modular code*.

**Next**: Committee review with current draft (January), causal identification strengthening, September 2025 submission.

Best,  
Angie
