## Example: Bug Report → Instant Fix

**Bug 1** (Ch4): Examples used generic companies (Hope Care, True Botanicals) instead of AV industry cases from Table 3.2

**Bug 2** (Ch3): Table caption still said "Vagueness" instead of "Breadth"

**Fix**: [View diff →](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/golden-cage-thesis/commit/0bbb3c8)

```
Ch3: "Vagueness Measure" → "Breadth Measure" in Table 3.2
Ch4: Updated examples to AV industry:
     - Aurora (zoom-out mover, 3.2×)
     - Cruise (zoom-in mover, 2.9×)
     - Argo AI (stayer, 1.0×)
```

## Core Variables

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
|:------:|:-----|:-----------|
| $F$ | Flexibility | Latent governance capacity to keep multiple paths viable |
| $R$ | Repositioning | Observable change in strategic breadth: $R = \|B_T - B_0\|$ |
| $B$ | Breadth | Strategic breadth from company descriptions |
| $G$ | Growth | Binary: reached Later Stage VC (Series C+) |

**Core finding**: Funding → (−) Repositioning → (+) Growth

## Where I Need Your Lens

| For Charlie | For Scott |
|:------------|:----------|
| Is the clockspeed/modularity connection clear enough? | How does "golden cage" differ from standard real options? |
| Does §5 (Escaping the Cage) feel operationally grounded? | Is "commit to reposition" actionable for founders? |
| Where should I strengthen the flexibility implementation angle? | Where should I sharpen the identification strategy? |
