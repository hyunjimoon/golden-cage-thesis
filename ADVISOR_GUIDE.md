## Feedback Integration Examples

| Input | Response | Diff |
|:------|:---------|:-----|
| **Charlie:** "Domain-specific, not universal" | Added industry heterogeneity (Ch4): Hardware −0.11, Quantum +0.10. Quantum exception = boundary condition. | [→](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/golden-cage-thesis/commit/3d67964) |
| **Charlie + Lorry:** "Correlation ≠ causation" | Reframed: selection IS the mechanism (Van den Steen sorting). Results = "correlational patterns," not causal claims. | [→](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/golden-cage-thesis/commit/8b40738) |
| **Charlie + Lorry:** "Survival bias?" | ITT logic: 97% observed (only 3% "Out of Business"). Robustness: Mover advantage holds at Yr3+ (2.35×), Yr5+ (2.12×). | [→](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/golden-cage-thesis/commit/d9b5ae8) |
| **Charlie + Lorry:** "Alternative mechanisms?" | Added §6.2: Moral Hazard, Milestone Pressure, Burn-rate. Quantum exception favors governance account. | [→](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/golden-cage-thesis/commit/543f4f5) |
| **Miaomiao:** "Less is more" | Cut 94 lines. Removed Manufacturing Analogy, redundant Related Work. | [→](https://github.com/hyunjimoon/golden-cage-thesis/commit/aceaf88) |

|:--|:--|
| N | 168,011 ventures (PitchBook 2021–2025) |
| H1 | ρ(E,R) = −0.133*** |
| H2 | Movers 2.60× Stayers (17.6% vs 6.7%) |
| H3 | ρ(E,G) = −0.04 overall; −0.11 Hardware; +0.10 Quantum |

> **H3 sensitivity:** Flips to +0.15 when M&A = success. H1/H2 robust. (Appendix C)
