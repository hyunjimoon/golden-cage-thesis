## Core Variables

| Symbol | Name | Definition |
|:------:|:-----|:-----------|
| $F$ | Flexibility | Latent governance capacity to keep multiple paths viable |
| $R$ | Repositioning | Observable change in strategic breadth: $R = \|B_T - B_0\|$ |
| $B$ | Breadth | Strategic breadth from company descriptions |
| $G$ | Growth | Binary: reached Later Stage VC (Series C+) |

**Core finding**: Funding → (−) Repositioning → (+) Growth

## Where I Need Your Lens

| For Charlie | For Scott |
|:------------|:----------|
| How does the $F \to R \to G$ chain connect to clockspeed/modularity? | How does "golden cage" differ from standard real options? |
| Is §5 (Escaping the Cage) operationally grounded enough? | Is "commit to reposition" actionable for founders? |
| What's missing from the flexibility implementation angle? | Where should I sharpen the identification strategy? |
