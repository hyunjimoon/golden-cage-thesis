## Key Syntactic Patterns

### 1. Introduction Hook
```
"This thesis studies how modern service platforms, through algorithmic
and market design, leverage agents' flexibility to enhance operational
efficiency."
```
→ **Pattern**: "This thesis studies how [actor] through [method] [achieves outcome]"

### 2. Contribution Statement
```
"Chapter 2 initiates the study of two-sided flexibility in platforms:
by modeling how these incentives influence the likelihood of compatibility
between agents and the resulting matching size, we study whether and when
platforms should invest in flexibility across both market sides."
```
→ **Pattern**: "[Chapter N] initiates/investigates [topic]: by [method], we study [question]"

### 3. Part Transition
```
"Part II of the thesis focuses on optimizing specific operational levers
for flexibility. The digitization of modern platforms allows for algorithms
that provide better customization and timing to harness flexibility."
```
→ **Pattern**: "Part [N] focuses on [topic]. [Context statement that motivates]."

### 4. Managerial Implication
```
"Moreover, we identify that platforms may realize significant efficiency
gains by incorporating the horizontal interplay of flexibility when
designing different incentives."
```
→ **Pattern**: "Moreover, we identify that [actor] may [benefit] by [action]"
