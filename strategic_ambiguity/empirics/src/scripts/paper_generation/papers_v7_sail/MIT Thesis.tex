%%%%%%%%  Packages used in the sample chapters (not otherwise required) %%%

%% Package for code listing in Appendix A.
\usepackage{listings}%   documentation is here https://ctan.org/pkg/listings

%% Set chemical formulas nicely
\usepackage[version=4]{mhchem}%   documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/mhchem

%% Latin filler used in Chapter 1, with a test for package version date (https://ctan.org/pkg/lipsum)
\usepackage{lipsum}
\IfPackageAtLeastTF{lipsum}{2021/09/20}{\setlipsum{auto-lang=false}}{} % to avoid a hyphenation warning


%%%%%%%%%  Other optional packages used sample chapters  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Table related packages  

\usepackage{booktabs}% publication quality tables (https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs)

\usepackage{array}% Additional options for column formats (https://ctan.org/pkg/array)

\usepackage{dcolumn}% For alignment of numbers on the decimal place (https://ctan.org/pkg/dcolumn) 
  \newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}}% use with dcolumn package. Note: dcolumns are set in math mode.
  % syntax: d{x.y} where x is max number of digits before decimal and y is max number after.

% Package for multipage table in Appendix B.
\usepackage{longtable}% typeset multi-page tables (https://ctan.org/pkg/longtable)

%% Package for improved typography
\usepackage[nopatch=footnote]{microtype}% typographic fine-tuning (https://ctan.org/pkg/microtype)

%% Load this package if using the two-column nomenclature format, \begin{nomenclature*}
\usepackage{multicol}

%Fix the table in one place
\usepackage{float}

% Pandoc compatibility
\providecommand{\tightlist}{%
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}}

%%%%%%%%%  Graphics path (to figure files)  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Can set graphicspath to point to specific directories containing figures (the current directory is searched automatically)
%% For instance, to search a subdirectory of the current directory called "figures" and a parallel directory called "art", set:

% \graphicspath{ {figures/} {../art/} }% For details see: https://latexref.xyz/dev/latex2e.html#g_t_005cgraphicspath


%%%%%%%%%  Set-up for biblatex (APA style)  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% biblatex is very powerful, and you can customize most aspects the reference list and citations to suit your needs.
%%   documentation is here: https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex
%%   cheat sheet is here:   https://tug.ctan.org/info/biblatex-cheatsheet/biblatex-cheatsheet.pdf

%% IMPORTANT: Using APA style with natbib compatibility
%% This allows you to use \citep{} and \citet{} commands
%% DO NOT load \usepackage{natbib} in any chapter files - it conflicts with biblatex!

\usepackage[
  style=numeric,
  backend=biber,
  natbib=true,
  maxbibnames=99,      % CHANGED: increased to 99
  minbibnames=1,       % NEW: added minimum
  maxcitenames=2,      % NEW: added for citations
  mincitenames=1,      % NEW: added for citations
  sorting=nyt
]{biblatex}

\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}

%% Add your bibliography file
\addbibresource{golden_cage.bib}

%% Add your bibliography files here
%% to avoid split urls and stretched white space, you can make the bibliography ragged-right by uncommenting this:
%\AddToHook{cmd/bibsetup/after}{\raggedright}

%% To ensure citations are set, run: LaTeX --> Biber --> LaTeX --> LaTeX


%%%%%%%%%%  Option for "double spacing" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% The setspace package provides a tool for changing line separation. Use these two commands here:
%
% \usepackage{setspace}%  documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace
% \setstretch{1.1}% you can choose some other value for the stretch of space between lines
