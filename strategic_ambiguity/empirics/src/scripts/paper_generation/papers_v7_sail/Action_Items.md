## TIER 0: CRITICAL DEFENSE

### **#044: Causality Control & H0 [P0]**
> *Source: Lorry #1*
- **Gap:** Causal language risk.
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Action:**
  - **Estimand:** Insert: "I document a robust correlational pattern... consistent with a mechanism."
  - **H0:** Explicitly state Null Hypothesis (Resources -> Growth).
  - **Word Sweep:** Replace `suppresses`/`drives` with associative verbs.

### **#047: Measurement Validity (Breadth) [P0]**
> *Source: Lorry #3*
- **Gap:** Is $B$ just marketing fluff?
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Action:**
  - **Cross-Validation:** Validate text-based Breadth ($B$) against observable non-text signals (Product Category changes, Tech Tags, Customer Segment shifts).

### **#048: Data Transparency [P0]**
> *Source: Self*
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Action:**
  - **Figure 4:** Fill the placeholder (Initial DB -> US HQ -> Sample).
  - **Cleanup:** Remove empty 3.2.2. Verify "US Headquartered" filter in code.

### **#055: Commitment (C) Operationalization [P0]**
> *Source: 統·思 Evaluation 2026-01-13*
- **Gap:** Commitment (C) is the first variable in causal chain (C→E→R→G), yet lacks operational definition. Table 1 says "operational promises" but never defines measurement.
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Semantic Impact:** +2% RoT (closes L2 gap in CEF mechanism)
- **Syntax Impact:** +5 points (completes Table 1 variable definitions)
- **Effort:** 1 day
- **Action:**
  - **§3.3 Add C Measurement:**
    ```
    Commitment (C) operationalized as initial strategic specificity:
    (a) Product category count (fewer = higher commitment)
    (b) Milestone granularity in pitch materials (more specific = higher)
    (c) Investor agreement terms (staged milestones = higher commitment)
    → Construct 0-100 scale averaging components
    ```
  - **Empirical Validation:** Correlate C with E; test C moderation of E→R relationship
  - **Table 1 Update:** Add operationalization to C row

### **#056: Theorem 1 Proof (Appendix C) [P0]**
> *Source: 統·思 Evaluation 2026-01-13*
- **Gap:** Theorem 1 (μ(1−μ) < ε/B) stated but not derived. Reviewers will ask "where does this formula come from?"
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Semantic Impact:** +3% RoT (completes L3 generative layer)
- **Syntax Impact:** +3 points (adds Appendix C, Zhao compliance)
- **Effort:** 2 days
- **Action:**
  - **Create Appendix C: Proof of Theorem 1 (Caged Learning)**
    1. **Setup:** Bayesian updating with signal σ, prior belief μ, strategic breadth B
    2. **Van den Steen sorting:** Show entrepreneurs/investors have μ > μ_pop (selection effect)
    3. **Learning condition:** Belief shift ε = Δμ after observing σ
    4. **Threshold derivation:** When μ(1−μ) < ε/B, belief shift negligible → learning ceases
    5. **Intuition:** High μ (from sorting) + low B (from commitment) → condition satisfied
  - **§2.5.1 Update:** Add "(Proof: Appendix C)" after Theorem 1 statement

### **#057: Governance Homogeneity Measurement Limitation [P0]**
> *Source: 統·思 Evaluation 2026-01-13*
- **Gap:** Core claim "governance lacks skeptics" is inferred from low repositioning (behavior), not directly measured. Current §6.3 acknowledgment too brief (1 sentence).
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Semantic Impact:** +1.5% RoT (elevates honesty about inference)
- **Syntax Impact:** +2 points (strengthens §6.3 limitations)
- **Effort:** 0.5 day
- **Action:**
  - **§6.3 Expansion (1¶ → 3¶):**
    ```
    Third—and most critically—I infer governance homogeneity from
    behavioral outcomes (low repositioning), not direct measurement.

    This inference is theoretically grounded (Van den Steen's sorting
    equilibrium predicts belief convergence) but remains INDIRECT.

    Without direct measurement of:
    - Board belief diversity
    - Voting records on strategic pivots
    - Investor-founder disagreement surveys

    ...the governance mechanism remains a well-supported conjecture
    rather than established fact.

    Future work MUST directly measure board composition diversity through
    (a) surveys of founder/investor disagreement, (b) voting records,
    (c) text analysis of investor communications.
    ```
  - **Abstract ¶2 Update:** Add "inferred from repositioning behavior and theoretically grounded in sorting equilibria"

## TIER 1: LOGIC & STRUCTURE

### **#043: Pattern vs Mechanism Re-org [P1]**
> *Source: User Instruction #5*
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Action:**
  - **Chapter 2 (Theory):** Focus on Observed Patterns (**EG, ER, RG**).
  - **Chapter 3 (ID):** Focus on Causal Mechanisms (**CEF**: C -> E -> F, **FG**: F -> G).
  - **Figure 2 Update:** Map Latent vs Measured variables to this structure.

### **#045: Alternative Explanations [P1]**
> *Source: Lorry #2*
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Action:**
  - Compare "Governance Homogeneity" against **Milestone Pressure**, **Burn-rate Discipline**, **Moral Hazard**.
  - Show why data patterns favor Homogeneity.

### **#046: Deep Tech & Commitment Types [P1]**
> *Source: Eze #1, #2, #3, #4*
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Action:**
  - **Deep Tech:** Add "Chicago Booth Approach" (Non-dilutive funding/Grants) as a survival strategy for Quantum/Deep Tech in Ch.4.
  - **Commitment Distinction:** Contrast **"Staged Commitment"** (Milestone-based, Signal up) vs **"Partial Commitment"** (Low interest, Signal down).

### **#041: Magnitude Contextualization [P1]**
> *Source: TR-01*
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Action:**
  - Calculate effect size in practical terms (4-6% per SD).
  - Benchmark against comparable studies (accelerator impact ~5%).
  - Add contextualization to Abstract and Ch.4.

### **#058: Quantum Exception Streamline [P1]**
> *Source: 統·思 Evaluation 2026-01-13*
- **Gap:** §4.3.3 provides deep theory (Anderson & Tushman) explaining Quantum exception, but disrupts Chapter 4 empirical flow (too verbose).
- **Owner:** CLI1
- **Semantic Impact:** +1% RoT (improves readability without losing insight)
- **Syntax Impact:** +3 points (better chapter flow)
- **Effort:** 0.5 day
- **Action:**
  - **Create Appendix D: Theoretical Foundations of the Quantum Exception**
  - **Move §4.3.3 paragraphs 4-8** (Anderson & Tushman "Era of Ferment" through boundary conditions) to Appendix D
  - **Retain 2-3¶ intuition in §4.3.3:**
    ```
    The Quantum industry's positive correlation (ρ = +0.095*) reveals
    a boundary condition: when no dominant design exists, commitment
    cannot foreclose unidentifiable alternatives. Under extreme
    uncertainty, capital funds architectural search rather than path
    commitment, reversing the rigidity trap (dR/dE > 0). The product
    term flips from negative to positive.

    (Full theoretical development: Appendix D.)
    ```

### **#059: Chapter Conclusions (Ch.2, Ch.4) [P1]**
> *Source: 統·思 Evaluation 2026-01-13*
- **Gap:** Zhao's 6-section template includes explicit conclusions (N.6) that summarize and bridge to next chapter. Ch.2 and Ch.4 end with hypotheses/statements rather than formal conclusions.
- **Owner:** CLI2
- **Semantic Impact:** +0.5% RoT (improves synthesis clarity)
- **Syntax Impact:** +4 points (achieves full Zhao N.1-N.6 compliance)
- **Effort:** 0.5 day
- **Action:**
  - **Add §2.7 Conclusion to Chapter 2:**
    ```
    This chapter developed the golden cage mechanism—a theoretical
    account of how funding suppresses growth through governance
    homogeneity rather than moral hazard. The mechanism integrates
    Van den Steen's sorting equilibrium, Eisenberg's strategic ambiguity,
    and Ghemawat's commitment analysis into a unified framework.

    Three testable hypotheses follow: (H1) funding correlates negatively
    with growth, (H2) funding correlates negatively with repositioning,
    and (H3) repositioning correlates positively with growth.

    The next chapter describes how to test these hypotheses at
    population scale using 180,994 ventures from PitchBook.
    ```
  - **Add §4.6 Conclusion to Chapter 4:**
    ```
    This chapter confirmed all three hypotheses: (H1) ρ(E,G) = −0.196***,
    (H2) ρ(E,R) = −0.087***, and (H3) Mover advantage = 2.60×.

    Industry heterogeneity reveals boundary conditions: the golden cage
    binds tightest in capital-intensive sectors (Hardware: ρ = −0.108,
    Transportation: ρ = −0.101) but releases under extreme uncertainty
    (Quantum: ρ = +0.095).

    Having documented *where* the cage bites, the next chapter addresses
    *how* to escape it through governance design.
    ```

### **#060: Contribution Statement Formalization [P1]**
> *Source: 統·思 Evaluation 2026-01-13*
- **Gap:** §1.3 lists three contributions ("First, I document... Second, I identify..."), which is clear but doesn't follow Zhao's "Chapter N initiates..." pattern.
- **Owner:** CLI2
- **Semantic Impact:** 0% RoT (no change to substance)
- **Syntax Impact:** +2 points (full Zhao pattern compliance)
- **Effort:** 0.25 day
- **Action:**
  - **Optional Enhancement:** Each chapter introduction add:
    "This chapter [initiates/investigates] X: by [method], we study [question]."
  - **Example (Ch.2):**
    ```
    This chapter develops the golden cage mechanism: by synthesizing
    Van den Steen's sorting equilibrium, Eisenberg's strategic ambiguity,
    and Ghemawat's commitment analysis, we study why funding suppresses
    repositioning through governance homogeneity rather than moral hazard.
    ```
