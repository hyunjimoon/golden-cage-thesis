# Glossary of Main Terms

• **Funding Paradox**: the negative correlation between early-stage capital and later-stage survival (ρ = −0.196, N = 180,994); resolves through the core equation dG/dE = (dG/dR) × (dR/dE) = (+) × (−) = (−).

• **Golden Cage**: the structural constraint that prevents adaptation regardless of founder intent, arising when operational commitment attracts investors who share the founder's thesis, thereby filtering skeptics from governance and eliminating signal diversity.

• **Commitment**: the allocation of resources to a specific strategic path in ways that foreclose alternatives; creates value through lock-in but destroys flexibility.

• **Flexibility**: the organizational capacity to reposition in response to market feedback; the capacity that commitment destroys.

• **Commitment Trap**: the mechanism through which funding suppresses repositioning (dR/dE < 0); funding selects for investors whose beliefs align with the committed strategy.

• **Flexibility Premium**: the growth benefit of maintaining adaptive capacity (dG/dR > 0); Movers outperform Stayers by 2.60×.

• **Early-stage Funding (E)**: capital raised through Series A; shapes governance composition through investor selection.

• **Growth (G)**: venture survival to later stages, operationalized as Series C+ funding, IPO, or acquisition.

• **Repositioning (R)**: measurable strategic movement calculated as R = |B_T − B₀|; the observable consequence of flexibility.

• **Strategic Breadth (B)**: the scope of potential markets implied by a venture's positioning, measured 0–100 via text analysis; high B = vague, low B = precise.

• **Strategic Ambiguity**: deliberate positioning that admits multiple stakeholder interpretations; enables "unified diversity" (Eisenberg, 1984).

• **Belief Homogeneity**: convergence of beliefs among governance participants through selection rather than persuasion.

• **Signal Diversity**: dissenting viewpoints within governance that champion alternative interpretations; destroyed by belief homogeneity.

• **Caged Learning**: the state where learning ceases endogenously; formally, when μ(1−μ) < ε/B.

• **Sorting Equilibrium**: agents with similar beliefs systematically match (Van den Steen, 2010); explains belief homogeneity without irrationality.

• **Mover**: a venture with any strategic repositioning (R > 0); 18.1% survival rate.

• **Stayer**: a venture with no repositioning (R = 0); 7.0% survival rate.

• **Zoom-in**: a Mover narrowing strategic breadth over time (ΔB < 0).

• **Zoom-out**: a Mover expanding strategic breadth over time (ΔB > 0).

• **Quantum Exception**: Quantum Computing ventures show positive ρ(E,G) = +0.095; where no dominant design exists, capital funds search rather than lock-in.

• **Era of Ferment**: industry phase with fundamental architectural uncertainty; cage mechanism weakens.

• **Dominant Design**: technological architecture achieving increasing returns and standardization.

• **Non-Dilutive Funding**: capital without equity exchange or board seats (grants, partnerships, prizes); avoids governance homogenization.

• **Vision-level Commitment**: commitment to abstract direction accommodating multiple implementation paths; preserves flexibility.

• **Operational Commitment**: commitment to specific mechanisms that foreclose alternatives; creates cage.

• **Preserve Skeptics**: governance principle that boards should include members who doubt current strategy.

• **Provisional Commitment**: commitment structured for revision; committing to the process of repositioning, not to position.

• **LTE Framework**: Layers of Theoretical Explanation (Kozlowski et al., 2025); Layer 1 = construct/what, Layer 2 = process/how, Layer 3 = mechanism/why.
