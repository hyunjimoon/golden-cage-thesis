# Miaomiao Feedback Response

**Core Principle: LESS IS MORE**

---

## Summary of Feedback & Responses

### 1. Too Many Citations in Introduction
**Feedback**: Don't cite Van den Steen (2010), Eisenberg (1984) upfront. Say it in plain words.

**Response**: AGREE. Simplify to:
> "More capital should improve outcomes, but funding also constrains repositioning capacity. I call this the *golden cage*."

**Action**: Remove citations from intro sentence. Move to Related Work.

---

### 2. "Venture Flexibility" Unclear
**Feedback**: Process vs. venture not comparable. Do you mean process vs. outcome? Product vs. market?

**Response**: AGREE. The term is confusing.

**Action**: Replace "Venture Flexibility" with **"Strategic Flexibility"** (ability to change product/market positioning). Keep "Process Flexibility" (Fine's operations concept) separate.

---

### 3. "Structural" Ambiguous
**Feedback**: What does "structural" mean? Term sheets? VC-backed vs bootstrapped?

**Response**: AGREE. Term is overloaded.

**Action**: Define clearly:
> "Structural constraint = governance composition prevents pivoting (board lacks skeptics)"
>
> NOT about term sheets, funding structure, or legal constraints.

---

### 4. Structural vs. Motivational - Why Introduce Both?
**Feedback**: Why introduce "motivational constraint"? Too many new terms.

**Response**: AGREE. The distinction is:
- **Cannot pivot** (no board support) ← This is the thesis focus
- **Will not pivot** (moral hazard) ← This is the alternative explanation

**Action**: Frame as "ruling out moral hazard" rather than introducing new terminology.

---

### 5. Van den Steen Reference Needs Context
**Feedback**: Explain what the paper is about in a nutshell before building on it.

**Response**: AGREE.

**Action**: Add one sentence:
> "Van den Steen (2010) shows that confident managers attract like-minded employees, producing belief homogeneity. I extend this to investor selection: confident founders attract like-minded investors."

---

### 6. Literature Review - "Carve a Gap"
**Feedback**: Three literature streams seem loosely related. Show what remains unanswered.

**Response**: AGREE. Current structure = "here are three blocks." Better structure = "here's the gap."

**Action**: Restructure to:
1. **What we know**: Funding helps (resource view), Pivoting matters (strategic agility)
2. **What we don't know**: How funding affects pivoting capacity
3. **This thesis**: Funding → Belief homogeneity → Reduced pivoting → Lower growth

---

### 7. Causal Chain Clarity
**Feedback**: Which arrows are you actually testing?

**Response**: Critical point. Be explicit.

**Action**: State clearly:
```
C → E → F↓ → R↓ → G↓

Tested:
- H1: E → R (ρ = -0.087***)  ← TESTED
- H2: R → G (2.60× advantage) ← TESTED
- H3: E → G (ρ = -0.196***)  ← TESTED (net effect)

Not tested (assumed from theory):
- C → E (commitment attracts capital)
- E → F↓ (funding reduces flexibility)
```

## Priority Edits (1 Hour)

| Priority | Section | Change |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **1** | Ch.1 Intro | Remove Van den Steen/Eisenberg citations. Plain language. |
| **2** | Ch.2 Theory | Add 1-sentence Van den Steen explanation |
| **3** | Ch.2 Theory | Remove "motivational constraint" term. Just say "ruling out moral hazard" |
| **4** | Ch.4 Empirics | Add explicit arrow-to-hypothesis mapping |

---

## What NOT To Change

- Keep "golden cage" metaphor (Miaomiao didn't object)
- Keep 2.60× as primary result (verified)
- Keep causal chain diagram (just clarify which parts tested)

---

## One-Liner Summary for Defense

> "Funding attracts believers who crowd out skeptics. When the market signals pivot, no one advocates. The venture is caged—not by lack of will, but lack of governance diversity."
