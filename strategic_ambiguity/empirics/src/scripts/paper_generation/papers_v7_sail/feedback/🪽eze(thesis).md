1. Sloan faculty for our 15.431 Entrepreneurial Finance & VC class in the fall term Matthew Rhodes-Kropf and Tong Liu advocated for the partial commitment / milestone investment strategy. In fact they advocated this approach for students seeking to enter VC/private investing career paths, and informed students seeking to become entrepreneurs to expect "smart" VCs to deploy this type of investment approach in funding rounds

> **[ADDRESSED]** Added §4.3.5 "Commitment Types: Staged vs. Partial" with distinction table:
>
> | Type | Description | Signal | Golden Cage Effect |
> |:-----|:------------|:-------|:-------------------|
> | **Staged Commitment** | Milestone-based funding | Positive (investor confidence) | Strong cage effect |
> | **Partial Commitment** | Tentative funding | Negative (investor doubt) | Weak cage effect |
>
> Key insight aligned with Rhodes-Kropf/Liu: *"Staged commitment attracts like-minded investors who believe the milestones are achievable—creating governance homogeneity."* (Lines 709-720)
>
> **Note:** Updated Mover Advantage from 1.81× to 2.60× based on refined R > 0 definition (see §3.3.3).

2. Section 4.2 Addressing the Challenges of Financing 'Deep Tech' is interesting and aligns with the approach we took at UChicago. Since it was rare for the early stage quantum and deep tech companies to secure VC funding, we tailored the entrepreneurial educational framework and resources to equip the founders to capture non-dilutive (mostly national/federal government) funding sources and then secure matching grants from state and local governments agencies and municipalities. This approach enabled the deep tech companies to survive and continue working towards key milestones while attaining recognition, support and resources from reputable agencies and research institutions that served as signals to private investors.

> **[ADDRESSED]** Added §4.3.4 "Deep Tech Strategy: Non-Dilutive Alternatives" (Lines 696-706):
>
> *"The 'Chicago Booth Approach': Deep tech ventures operating in eras of ferment can pursue grants, government contracts, and strategic partnerships that provide capital without attracting thesis-driven investors."*
>
> Non-dilutive sources explicitly listed:
> - **Government grants:** NSF, DARPA, DOE provide capital without board seats
> - **Strategic partnerships:** Corporate R&D agreements fund exploration without equity
> - **Prize competitions:** XPRIZE-style awards reward outcomes without governance control
>
> This aligns directly with UChicago's quantum/deep-tech approach. The Fast Ion Battery case could be added as an appendix example.

4. Partial commitment indicates a small check with no signal of follow on… low interest, low commitment level, minimal skin in the game. Staged commitment more clearly signals a path to future capital or at the very least a willingness to stay involved with disciplined risk management as the founder achieves key milestones and executes on metrics and KPIs

> **[ADDRESSED]** Incorporated nuanced distinction in §4.3.5 Table (Lines 715-716):
>
> - **Staged Commitment**: "Positive signal (investor confidence)" - aligns with Eze's point about "path to future capital"
> - **Partial Commitment**: "Negative signal (investor doubt)" - aligns with "low interest, minimal skin in the game"
>
> Added strategic implication: *"Paradoxically, ventures that receive 'confident' funding (staged commitment with aggressive milestones) may face stronger golden cage constraints than ventures receiving 'tentative' funding (partial commitment with flexible expectations)."* (Line 720)
>
> This captures the tension: staged commitment signals investor quality but creates cage; partial commitment signals doubt but preserves flexibility.
