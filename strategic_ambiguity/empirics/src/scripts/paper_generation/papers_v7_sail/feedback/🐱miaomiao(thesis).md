1. "? I synthesize Van den Steen's (2010) sorting equilibrium, Eisenberg's (1984) strategic"
-> I think here you don't need to cite these literatures but just say in plain words. Smt like naturally more capital leads to better performance outcome, but this abundance of financial funding also can constrain the ability and capability for ventures to reposition (if you use the word "pivot" make sure to cite the Kirtley & O'Mahony 2023 paper: https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.3131), which you termed as the "gold cage" theory.

2. "Figure 3a: Process Flexibility vs. Venture Flexibility."
-> not sure what do you mean by venture flex here i see process and venture not comparable - do you mean process vs outcome or product and market?

3. "structural"
-> are you sure it's structural?
-> i am still having some problem understanding what you meant by "structure" financial funding? structure of the term sheets/ venture-backed vs self-sustained startup?

4. "should neither be increased nor decreased; however, the venture would benefit from"
-> not until here i *think* i understand what you meant by "structure" is just how they prioritize operational vs vision committment - is this correct?

5. Structural vs. motivational constraint. We distinguish "cannot pivot" (structural) from "will not pivot"
-> why "motivational" constraint needs to be introduced here?
-> I think you are trying to tie too much litearture/ academic jargon here. I feel a bit lost reading till this point. Less is more. You can significantly reduce the terms you introduce in the theory and clearly state simply why funding may constrain flexibility from the operational and vision perspectives. If motivational constraint is linked to vision then clearly state the rationale. Avoid introducing too many new terms (which I haven't seen before!) in your mechanism diagnosis

6. "r skeptics from governance, producing belief homogeneity that eliminates learning capacity. Layer 3 specifies the generative"
-> I see you reference/build upon the study by Van den Steen. Maybe nice to introduce the reader in simple terms what the paper is about in a nutshell, what're the key assumptions involved, and what are the parameters you are borrowing and what you added on top for your caged learning condition.

7. "related work"
-> I love how you can span three categories of literature but they seem to be a bit loosely related. The way you do literature review is to "carve" a gap. What remains unanswered based on the stream of lit development instead of throwing chunks of theory blocks and assume readers know how to connect the dots.

8. vision. But this same mechanism traps the venture later: any pivot threatens someone's projected interpretation, and that someone now sits on the board. The causal chain is: C → E → F ↓→ R ↓→ G ↓ Where C = Commitment, E = Early funding, F = Flexibility, R = Repositioning, G = Growth. See Glossary for definitions.

-> i haven't read your empirics yet but am i correct that you are not tackling all parts of the causal chains in your study? Is there specific arrow(s) that each of your hypothesis in your study is being tested for?
