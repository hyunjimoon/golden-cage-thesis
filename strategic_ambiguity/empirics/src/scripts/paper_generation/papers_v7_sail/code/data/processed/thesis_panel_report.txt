[1] Sample Size
    N = 168,011

[2] Growth Rate (G = BINARY: Later Stage VC)
    G = 1: 18,398 (11.0%)
    (Thesis target: ~11.5%)

[3] Movement Classification
    stayer: 102,742 (61.2%)
    zoom_out: 36,944 (22.0%)
    zoom_in: 28,325 (16.9%)
    (Thesis target: Movers ~40%, Stayers ~60%)

[4] Growth by Mover Type (Mover Advantage)
    Movers: 17.6%
    Stayers: 6.7%
    Mover Advantage: 2.60x
    (Thesis target: 18.1% / 7.0% = 2.60x)

[5] Key Correlations (n=168,011)
    NOTE: G is BINARY (Later Stage VC), not continuous!
    ρ(G, log(E)) = -0.0416 *** (Funding-Growth Paradox)
      (Thesis target: -0.196***)
    ρ(R, log(E)) = -0.1333 *** (Commitment Cage)
      (Thesis target: -0.087***)
    ρ(G, R)      = +0.1836 *** (Flexibility Flex)
      (Thesis target: positive)
