# Figure Placement Review Request

**Purpose:** Review whether the 11 thesis figures are optimally placed in their assigned chapters.

## Thesis Structure (6 Chapters)

| Chapter | Title | Core Question | Key Finding |
|:--------|:------|:--------------|:------------|
| Ch.1 | Introduction | Why does funding != growth? | dG/dE < 0; paradox exists |
| Ch.2 | Golden Cage Mechanism | How does capital trap? | dR/dE < 0; commitment trap |
| Ch.3 | Data & Identification | How to measure? | N=180,994; panel 2021-2025 |
| Ch.4 | Where the Cage Bites | What enables growth? | dG/dR > 0; Movers 2.02x |
| Ch.5 | Strategic Flexibility | When to commit? | Q3 breadth optimal (15.0%) |
| Ch.6 | Conclusion | So what? | Move to Grow framework |

## Questions to Evaluate

### 1. Figure-Chapter Fit
For each figure, evaluate:
- Does the figure directly support the chapter's core question?
- Could this figure fit better in a different chapter?
- Is the figure essential or redundant?

### 2. Specific Concerns

**Ch4_Fig3_growth_by_direction.png:**
- Currently in Ch.4 "Where the Cage Bites" (empirical results)
- Shows B trajectories (narrowing/broadening/stayer) AND growth outcomes
- Alternative placement: Ch.2 (mechanism) since it illustrates the B trajectory concept?
- Or stay in Ch.4 since it shows growth RESULTS by direction?

**Ch2_Fig1_B_trajectories.png vs Ch4_Fig3:**
- Both show B trajectories over time
- Fig3 in Ch.2 = conceptual illustration
- Fig7 in Ch.4 = empirical results with growth outcomes
- Is this redundancy intentional and valuable, or confusing?

**Ch6_Fig1_growth_diagnostics.png:**
- Fine-Hausmann framework in Conclusion chapter
- Could this be better as a conceptual framing in Ch.1 or Ch.2?
- Or is it appropriate as a "synthesis" figure in Conclusion?

### 3. Chapter Load Balance

| Chapter | Current # Figures | Assessment |
|:--------|:-----------------|:-----------|
| Ch.1 | 2 | Appropriate (paradox + mechanism overview) |
| Ch.2 | 2 | Appropriate (trajectories + E-R correlation) |
| Ch.3 | 0 | Acceptable (data chapter, tables suffice) |
| Ch.4 | 5 | Heavy - is this appropriate for results chapter? |
| Ch.5 | 1 | Light - could use more? |
| Ch.6 | 1 | Appropriate (synthesis framework) |

## Requested Output

Please provide:

1. **Overall Assessment:** Is the current placement logical?

2. **Specific Recommendations:** For any figure that should move:
   - Which chapter should it move to?
   - Why?
   - What ordering within that chapter?

3. **Redundancy Check:** Are any figures redundant or could be combined?

4. **Missing Figures:** Are there gaps where a figure would strengthen the argument?

5. **Alternative Structure:** If you were to reorganize, what would the optimal figure-chapter mapping be?

## Context: Key Variables

| Symbol | Variable | Meaning |
|:-------|:---------|:--------|
| E | Early Funding | First financing (M USD) |
| R | Reposition | Strategic pivot magnitude |
| G | Growth | Later-stage success (0/1) |
| B | Breadth | Strategic ambiguity level |
| L | Later Stage | Same as G (success indicator) |

**Core Equation:** `dG/dE = (dG/dR) x (dR/dE) = (+) x (-) = (-)`
