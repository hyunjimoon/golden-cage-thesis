## Iteration 1: Issue Identification

---

## Chapter 1: Introduction (20 Issues)

### Structural Issues
1. **[Ch1-01] Opening sentence too abstract**: "Commitment structures and investor selection cage founders' strategic flexibility" - reader doesn't know what "commitment structures" means yet
2. **[Ch1-02] Second sentence jumps topic**: "Startups die not for lack of resources, but for lack of mobility" - no transition from first sentence
3. **[Ch1-03] Tesla/Better Place example appears before problem is framed**: Example comes in paragraph 2, but the theoretical framework isn't established
4. **[Ch1-04] "Funding-Growth Paradox" section lacks motivation**: Jumps straight to correlation without explaining why this is surprising

### Clarity Issues
5. **[Ch1-05] "Horizontal" and "vertical" metaphors unexplained**: "how funding and flexibility interact horizontally...governance composition affects strategic adaptation vertically"
6. **[Ch1-06] Term "mobility" ambiguous**: Used for "strategic mobility" but could be confused with mobility industry
7. **[Ch1-07] Equation appears without narrative setup**: ρ(Funding, Growth) = -0.196 drops in without context
8. **[Ch1-08] "Commitment Cage" and "Flexibility Flex" introduced but not defined**: Terms used before formal definition
9. **[Ch1-09] Figure 1.2 caption uses jargon**: "Upper path (measured)", "Lower path (unmeasured)" without explanation
10. **[Ch1-10] "Part I" and "Part II" framing inconsistent with chapter numbering**: Thesis has 6 chapters, not two parts

### Flow Issues
11. **[Ch1-11] "Research Questions" section lacks explicit questions**: Section title promises questions but delivers overview
12. **[Ch1-12] "Argument Roadmap" repeats "Research Questions"**: Redundant content in two consecutive sections
13. **[Ch1-13] Contribution preview is list-heavy**: Three contributions as paragraphs starting with "First/Second/Third" feels mechanical
14. **[Ch1-14] No explicit transition to Chapter 2**: Chapter ends abruptly with horizontal rule
15. **[Ch1-15] Mediation structure introduced without explaining mediation**: Figure 1.2 shows DAG but doesn't explain what mediation means

### Missing Content
16. **[Ch1-16] No definition of "flexibility"**: Central concept used without definition until Chapter 2
17. **[Ch1-17] No definition of "repositioning"**: Another central concept undefined
18. **[Ch1-18] Industry heterogeneity mentioned but not motivated**: Why should reader care about industry differences?
19. **[Ch1-19] "Theorem 1 (Caged Learning)" mentioned without preview**: What is this theorem?
20. **[Ch1-20] No clear statement of thesis**: What exactly is the argument?

7. **[Ch2-07] "Blank slate status" reference unclear**: Christensen cited but concept not explained
8. **[Ch2-08] Theorem 1 notation introduced without variable definitions**: μ, ε, B defined only in theorem statement, not before
9. **[Ch2-09] "Stochastic enabler" jargon unexplained**: What does this mean in plain language?
10. **[Ch2-10] "Endogenous" used without definition**: Technical term for non-specialist readers
11. **[Ch2-11] Equation $dG/dE = (dL/dR) × (dR/dE)$ assumes reader knows chain rule**: Not all readers are mathematically trained
12. **[Ch2-12] "Sorting equilibrium" not explained for general reader**: Van den Steen cited but mechanism unclear

### Flow Issues
13. **[Ch2-13] Tesla/Better Place repeated from Ch1**: Same example, feels redundant
14. **[Ch2-14] Figure placement interrupts argument**: Figures 2-5 could be better sequenced
15. **[Ch2-15] "Empirical preview" lines feel like spoilers**: Breaks narrative tension
16. **[Ch2-16] "Structural vs. Motivational" subsection feels tacked on**: Important distinction but undersold

### Missing Content
17. **[Ch2-17] No plain-language summary of the theory**: What's the one-sentence takeaway?
