\section{Theoretical Contributions}\label{theoretical-contributions}}

This thesis makes three theoretical contributions:

\textbf{First}, I introduce the \emph{golden cage} mechanism, explaining how funding constrains growth through governance homogeneity rather than moral hazard. The mechanism integrates \citeauthor{vandensteen2010interpersonal}'s sorting equilibrium, \citeauthor{eisenberg1984ambiguity}'s strategic ambiguity, and \citeauthor{ghemawat1991commitment}'s commitment analysis.

\textbf{Second}, I distinguish vision-level commitment from operational commitment. This explains why well-funded ventures diverge: some (Tesla) preserve flexibility through vision commitment; others (Better Place) foreclose it through operational commitment.

\textbf{Third}, I formalize caged learning (Theorem 1), showing how funding endogenously produces conditions (high \ensuremath{\mu}, low B) that prevent founders from updating their beliefs.

\section{Practical Implications}\label{practical-implications}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item \textbf{Founders:} Commit to \emph{reposition}, not to position. Design governance to preserve skeptical voices \emph{before} funding eliminates them.
\item \textbf{Investors:} Fund platform capability, not product specificity. Expect successful ventures to reposition.
\item \textbf{Scholars:} The cage mechanism shows governance, not incentives, constrains ventures. Future research should directly measure board belief diversity.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{limitations}{%
\section{Limitations}\label{limitations}}

Three limitations warrant acknowledgment:

\textbf{First}, I document correlation, not causation. An alternative explanation remains: rigid founders attract more funding. I address this through three layers of defense: (1) selection is part of the mechanism; (2) conditioning on observables reduces selection; (3) future quasi-experimental approaches could provide identification.

\textbf{Second}, PitchBook overrepresents technology ventures in the United States. Generalization requires replication in other sectors and geographies.

\textbf{Third, and most critically, I infer governance homogeneity from behavioral outcomes (low repositioning), not direct measurement.} I derive the core claim, "governance lacks skeptics", from observing that well-funded ventures reposition less frequently. This behavioral pattern is \emph{consistent with} the sorting mechanism, but the mechanism itself remains unobserved.

Theory grounds this inference. \citeauthor{vandensteen2010interpersonal}'s \citeyearpar{vandensteen2010interpersonal} sorting equilibrium predicts that founders and investors with heterogeneous priors will sort into organizations led by like-minded others, a mathematical result, not an empirical claim. Applied to venture governance, this predicts belief convergence among board members. However, the prediction remains \emph{indirect}: I observe the predicted \emph{consequence} (low repositioning) rather than the posited \emph{cause} (belief homogeneity). The gap matters.

Future work must directly measure board composition diversity. Three approaches merit consideration: (a) survey-based measurement of founder-investor disagreement on strategic direction, (b) analysis of board voting records on strategic pivots, and (c) text analysis of investor communications (e.g., board meeting minutes, investor letters) to quantify belief divergence. Without such direct measurement, the governance homogeneity mechanism, while theoretically compelling and empirically consistent, remains a well-supported conjecture rather than established fact.

\hypertarget{alternative-explanations}{%
\subsection{Alternative Explanations}\label{alternative-explanations}}

The governance homogeneity mechanism proposed in this thesis competes with several alternative explanations for the funding-growth paradox. I consider three prominent alternatives and discuss why the evidence favors the governance account.

\input{table/alternatives.tex}

\textbf{Moral Hazard} predicts reduced founder effort after funding. Yet founders of failed well-funded ventures frequently express regret at not pivoting earlier, suggesting motivation was present but governance support was absent. If moral hazard drove the pattern, founders would report satisfaction with their strategic persistence, not regret about rigidity.

\textbf{Milestone Pressure} predicts that ventures deviating from milestones (i.e., Movers) should face capital constraints and underperform. The opposite obtains: Movers achieve 2.60\ensuremath{\times} higher success rates than Stayers. This suggests that the benefit of strategic adaptation outweighs the cost of milestone deviation, inconsistent with milestone pressure as the binding constraint.

\textbf{Burn-rate Discipline} predicts the cage should weaken in capital-light sectors where experimentation is cheap. Software's near-zero correlation (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.001) is consistent with this account. However, Quantum's positive correlation (\ensuremath{\rho} = +0.095) is inconsistent, if burn-rate were decisive, capital-intensive Quantum should show the strongest cage, not the weakest. The uncertainty-contingent pattern favors governance homogeneity over burn-rate as the primary mechanism.

Three directions merit further investigation:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Direct measurement of belief homogeneity:} Survey-based or text-based measurement of board belief diversity
\item
  \textbf{Quasi-experimental identification:} VC fund vintage effects, geographic shocks, or industry funding cycles as instruments
\item
  \textbf{Governance interventions:} Field experiments testing skeptic preservation strategies
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{closing}{%
\section{Closing}\label{closing}}

Capital is oxygen for startups, but oxygen in a sealed chamber becomes a cage.

This thesis began with a paradox: the \$330 billion venture capital industry exists to fuel growth, yet early-stage funding correlates negatively with later-stage survival (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.196, N = 180,994). The paradox \textbf{resolves} through decomposition: funding \textbf{suppresses} repositioning (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.087), and repositioning \textbf{drives} growth (Movers outperform Stayers by 2.60\ensuremath{\times}). The product of a positive and a negative is negative.

The mechanism I term the \emph{golden cage} operates through belief homogeneity. Securing capital requires commitments that attract investors who share the founder's thesis. Skeptics self-select out. The resulting board contains only believers: efficient for execution, destructive for learning. When market signals suggest pivoting, no one advocates alternatives. The venture cannot adapt, not for lack of will, but for lack of governance diversity.

Industry heterogeneity reveals boundary conditions. The cage binds tightest in capital-intensive sectors where switching costs are high: Hardware (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.108), Transportation (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.101). It releases under extreme uncertainty where no dominant design exists: Quantum (\ensuremath{\rho} = +0.095). The cage operates when commitment forecloses \emph{identifiable} alternatives; under radical uncertainty, no alternatives are identifiable, so commitment cannot foreclose them.

The cage need not be fatal. With deliberate governance design, committing at the vision level, preserving skeptics, building milestone flexibility, founders and investors can capture commitment's benefits without foreclosing adaptation. The prescription reduces to four words:

\textbf{Move to grow. When uncertain, commit to reposition, not to position.}
