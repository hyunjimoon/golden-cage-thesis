\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Strategic flexibility enables ventures to operationalize the Freedom Axiom \citep{stern2023}: the capacity to pursue the ``best available alternative'' requires maintaining multiple viable paths. New ventures possess this capacity naturally. Their ``blank slate'' status \citep{christensen1997innovators} permits strategic repositioning unconstrained by legacy commitments. Yet the funding process systematically \textbf{erodes} this flexibility precisely when ventures need it most to navigate uncertainty, a paradox this chapter resolves.

\textbf{Flexibility as Latent Capability.} I define strategic flexibility as the \textbf{latent capability} to pursue multiple paths within constrained resource spaces. This capability remains unobserved directly; I proxy it through \textbf{repositioning}, the observable behavioral manifestation of latent flexibility. Ventures that reposition demonstrate they possessed flexibility; those that remain static may lack the capability or choose not to exercise it. Critically, the data reveal that staying is rarely strategic: \textbf{Movers outperform Stayers by 2.60\ensuremath{\times}} (18.1\% vs.~7.0\% later-stage success, p < 0.001). This suggests that in early-stage ventures, lack of movement predominantly signals rigidity rather than perfection.

\textbf{The Funding-Growth Paradox.} Funding correlates negatively with later-stage success (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.196, p < 0.001). The paradox resolves through mediation: funding suppresses repositioning (the Commitment Trap), yet repositioning drives success (the Flexibility Premium). \citet{camuffo2020a} document that scientific experimentation improves pivot quality, yet securing capital to fund experimentation requires commitments that attract homogeneous believers. The paradox is structural: acquiring resources to learn reduces the governance diversity necessary to act on learning.

\textbf{The Core Asymmetry.} While traditional operations management views flexibility as a purchased asset \citep{jordan1995principles}, venture governance presents a fundamental asymmetry: capital does not ``buy'' flexibility; it often \textbf{erodes} it. As founders trade equity for resources, they import a governance sorting effect that homogenizes beliefs. Unlike a machine that remains flexible regardless of usage, a board loses its capacity to advocate for alternatives as it becomes populated solely by believers.

\citeauthor{eisenberg1984ambiguity}'s \citeyearpar{eisenberg1984ambiguity} ``strategic ambiguity'' functions as a \textbf{stochastic enabler} of flexibility. Founders who orchestrate ambiguous positioning attract diverse stakeholders who project their own interpretations onto capacious visions. This diversity unlocks future pivot capacity: when market signals suggest changing direction, at least some governance voices advocate for the alternative.

This chapter studies how funding creates a \emph{golden cage}, a structural trap that prevents founders from adapting, no matter how much they want to. The focus is on governance, not moral hazard or resource constraints. Specific commitments (operational) attract narrow coalitions; vague commitments (vision-level) attract diverse coalitions. The venture maximizes survival, which depends on both resources and pivot capacity.

\subsection{Contributions}\label{contributions}}

This chapter examines how commitment shapes governance. I characterize how funding constrains flexibility and identify optimal commitment structures.

\textbf{Optimal commitment structures.} Either vision-level or operational commitment can dominate the other. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 introduce two key effects: \emph{belief homogenization} and \emph{signal diversity loss}. Belief homogenization follows from operational commitment. Specific commitments attract like-minded investors, so governance diversity falls while shared conviction rises. But this conviction becomes wasteful when the committed direction proves wrong. Signal diversity loss arises under extreme operational commitment: board members who might champion alternatives never join governance. The venture ignores disconfirming signals and cannot recognize when it should pivot. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 characterize when these effects bind tightest; Section 2.5 identifies the dominant commitment structure across industry contexts.

\textbf{Synthesis of sorting and ambiguity theories.} The main theoretical contribution is synthesizing two established theories into a unified mechanism. Van den Steen's sorting equilibrium explains \emph{who} joins: optimists attract optimists, filtering out skeptics. Eisenberg's strategic ambiguity explains \emph{how many} join: vague visions attract diverse believers, while specific commitments attract narrow coalitions. I develop three analytical approaches to characterize how commitment shapes governance. Section 2.3 maps commitment type to governance composition and shows that belief homogenization lowers survival for operational commitment. Section 2.4 applies the flexibility premium analysis when strategic ambiguity produces high governance diversity. Section 2.5 formalizes Caged Learning (Theorem 1) to characterize when organizational learning ceases.

\textbf{Structural vs.~motivational constraint.} I distinguish "cannot pivot" (structural) from "will not pivot" (moral hazard), with distinct implications for intervention design. If founders \emph{will not} pivot due to reduced incentives, the prescription is intensified monitoring. If founders \emph{cannot} pivot due to structural constraints (the cage), the prescription is governance redesign, preserving skeptical voices before funding eliminates them.

\hypertarget{commitment-as-double-edged-sword}{%
\section{Commitment as Double-Edged Sword}\label{commitment-as-double-edged-sword}}

Strategy orthodoxy favors commitment. \citet{porter1996what} argues that competitive advantage requires choosing a unique position and making trade-offs that competitors cannot easily imitate. \citet{ghemawat1991commitment} provides the definitive treatment: commitment creates value through four mechanisms, lock-in (sunk costs), lock-out (competitor exclusion), lags (time advantages), and inertia (organizational momentum). The prescription follows: choose a defensible position, then commit.

But Ghemawat also identifies the flip side: commitment forecloses alternatives. Every dollar sunk into battery-swapping infrastructure is a dollar unavailable for charging infrastructure. Every milestone promised to investors is a constraint on strategic pivots. Commitment is a double-edged sword, valuable for credibility, costly for flexibility.

The tension intensifies in nascent markets. Under technological and demand uncertainty, commitment becomes a bet on incomplete information. \citet{dixit1994investment} formalize this through real options reasoning: when uncertainty is high (\ensuremath{\sigma}\ensuremath{\uparrow}), waiting becomes more valuable because the option to learn dominates the benefit of early commitment. \citet{sanchez1995strategic} extends this to strategic flexibility: firms facing environmental uncertainty should maintain "strategic flexibility", the capacity to respond to unforeseen contingencies.

\hypertarget{the-golden-cage-mechanism}{%
\section{The Golden Cage Mechanism}\label{the-golden-cage-mechanism}}

The \emph{golden cage} forms through a four-step sequence. The mechanism builds on a key insight: confident founders attract like-minded investors, producing belief homogeneity without any party behaving irrationally.

\textbf{Step 1: Commitment Attracts Believers.} Securing capital requires operational commitments, production architecture choices, go-to-market sequences, milestone definitions \citep{gompers2001the, hellmann2002venture}. Investors who fund a venture believe these specific commitments will succeed.

\textbf{Step 2: Believers Filter Skeptics.} People with different beliefs naturally sort into different organizations: optimists join ventures led by optimists, while skeptics stay away. \citeauthor{vandensteen2010interpersonal}'s \citeyearpar{vandensteen2010interpersonal} sorting equilibrium formalizes this: entrepreneurs who pursue a venture are more optimistic about it (selection, not bias), and investors who fund also share this optimism because pessimists self-select out. The result is belief homogeneity without any party behaving irrationally. The board contains no skeptics, not because skeptics were expelled, but because they never joined.

\textbf{Step 3: Homogeneity Eliminates Signals.} Without skeptics, disconfirming signals lack advocates \citep{cyert1963a}. Market feedback indicating problems with the committed approach has no champion in governance discussions. \citet{march1991exploration} identifies this tension: belief convergence is efficient for exploitation (executing a known strategy) but destructive for exploration (discovering whether the strategy is correct).

\textbf{Step 4: Signal Loss Prevents Learning.} The venture cannot recognize when it should pivot. Learning stops, not because founders lack motivation, but because the structure prevents it. The cage is structural: founders want to pivot but lack governance support.

\citet{eisenberg1984ambiguity} completes the mechanism through "strategic ambiguity." Early-stage ventures necessarily communicate with some vagueness, the future is genuinely uncertain. This ambiguity enables "unified diversity": stakeholders project their own interpretations onto vague visions. Tesla's "accelerating sustainable transport" attracted believers in electrification, autonomy, and energy transition, each projecting their thesis onto the same vision. But this same mechanism traps the venture later: any pivot threatens \emph{someone's} projected interpretation, and that someone now sits on the board.

The causal chain is:

\[C \rightarrow E \rightarrow F\downarrow \rightarrow R\downarrow \rightarrow G\downarrow\]

Where C = Commitment, E = Early funding, F = Flexibility, R = Repositioning, G = Growth. See Glossary for definitions.

\textbf{Which arrows are tested?} Chapter 4 tests three specific relationships:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{H1: E \ensuremath{\rightarrow} R} (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.087***): Funding suppresses repositioning (TESTED)
\item \textbf{H2: R \ensuremath{\rightarrow} G} (2.60\ensuremath{\times} Mover Advantage): Repositioning enables growth (TESTED)
\item \textbf{H3: E \ensuremath{\rightarrow} G} (\ensuremath{\rho} = -0.196***): Net negative effect of funding on growth (TESTED)
\end{itemize}
The arrows C \ensuremath{\rightarrow} E (commitment attracts capital) and E \ensuremath{\rightarrow} F (funding reduces flexibility) are assumed from theory, not directly tested.

\subsection{Formal Condition for Caged Learning}\label{formal-condition-for-caged-learning}}

Building on \citeauthor{levinthal1993the}'s \citeyearpar{levinthal1993the} insight that successful organizations become "myopic" through competency traps, I formalize when learning ceases:

\textbf{Theorem 1 (Caged Learning).} \emph{Learning ceases when}

\[\mu(1 - \mu) < \frac{\varepsilon}{B}\]

\emph{where \ensuremath{\mu} = belief probability, \ensuremath{\epsilon} = expected belief shift from a signal, and B = strategic breadth. (Proof: Appendix D.)}

Van den Steen's sorting equilibrium produces high \ensuremath{\mu} (shared optimism); operational commitments narrow B (strategic focus). Both forces push the inequality toward satisfaction, caged learning becomes \emph{endogenous} to the funding process itself.

\hypertarget{hypotheses}{%
\section{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

From the golden cage mechanism, I derive three testable hypotheses:

\textbf{Hypothesis 1 (Funding-Growth):} \emph{Early-stage funding correlates negatively with later-stage growth.}

\[H_1: \frac{dG}{dE} < 0\]

\textbf{Hypothesis 2 (Funding-Repositioning):} \emph{Early-stage funding correlates negatively with repositioning.}

\[H_2: \frac{dR}{dE} < 0\]

\textbf{Hypothesis 3 (Repositioning-Growth):} \emph{Strategic repositioning correlates positively with growth.}

\[H_3: \frac{dG}{dR} > 0\]

Together, these hypotheses complete the decomposition:

\[\frac{dG}{dE} = \frac{dG}{dR} \times \frac{dR}{dE} = (+) \times (-) = (-)\]
