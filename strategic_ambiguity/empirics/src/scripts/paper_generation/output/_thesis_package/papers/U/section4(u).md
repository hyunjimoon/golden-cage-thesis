# Paper U: When Vagueness Pays
## Section 4: Discussion (¶33-40)

### ¶33. Summary of Findings

This paper documents three main findings from our analysis of 180,860 technology ventures. First, we reject signaling theory's monotonic prediction: the Spearman correlation between vagueness and success is ρ = +0.024 (p < 0.001), positive rather than the negative value predicted under the signaling null. Second, we establish the Movement Principle: ventures that repositioned succeed at 18.1% compared to 7.0% for those that stayed fixed, a 2.6× advantage that dominates any positioning effect. Third, we resolve the Q3 anomaly by showing that differential movement rates, not positioning per se, explain aggregate success patterns across vagueness quartiles.

### ¶34. Theoretical Implications

These findings reframe the vagueness debate from positioning to adaptation. Traditional signaling theory and strategic ambiguity arguments both focus on initial positioning—where to start on the precision-vagueness spectrum. Our evidence suggests this framing is incomplete. Vagueness may create strategic options, consistent with real options theory (McGrath, 1999), but options generate value only when exercised. The Movement Principle suggests that the exercise component dominates the holding component. This interpretation reconciles signaling theory (which favors precision) with strategic ambiguity (which favors vagueness) by identifying a third factor—adaptation—that matters more than either extreme. Importantly, our contribution extends beyond Zuckerman's (1999) categorical penalty and Pontikes's (2012) audience-dependent effects by showing that static versus dynamic positioning is the first-order distinction.

### ¶35. Practical Implications for Entrepreneurs

For entrepreneurs, our findings suggest prioritizing adaptation over initial positioning optimization. The 2.6× success advantage for movers over stayers substantially exceeds any advantage from positioning at a particular vagueness level. Entrepreneurs should: (a) secure positioning flexibility early, which may favor moderate-to-high initial vagueness; (b) commit to adaptation as conditions warrant, as movement itself predicts success; and (c) avoid optimizing initial positioning at the expense of future adaptability. The worst outcome in our data is not wrong positioning but static positioning: among stayers, even the best-positioned quartile (Q2 at 7.5%) substantially underperforms movers in the worst-positioned quartile (Q2 movers at 16.1%).

### ¶36. Practical Implications for Investors

For investors, our findings suggest tracking repositioning as a positive signal. Ventures that demonstrate adaptation may be more likely to succeed regardless of their initial positioning. This suggests: (a) monitoring portfolio company positioning changes over time; (b) interpreting positioning shifts as potentially positive rather than concerning; and (c) considering how investment terms affect founder willingness to adapt. The Movement Principle also suggests caution about over-specifying milestones that might discourage beneficial pivots.

### ¶37. Limitations: Correlational Design

Our primary limitation is the correlational nature of our evidence. We document associations between vagueness, movement, and success, but cannot establish causation. Movers may differ systematically from stayers in unobserved ways—founder quality, market conditions, investor networks—that drive both adaptation and success. The 2.6× movement advantage could reflect reverse causality (ventures on success trajectories have resources to reposition), selection effects (certain founder types both adapt more and succeed more), or omitted variables (market dynamism drives both movement and success). We mitigate these concerns through temporal stability analysis: if omitted variables or selection drove our results, we would expect coefficient instability across the distinct market regimes of 2023-2025. Instead, all key relationships maintain consistent sign and significance across years (see Figure R2), providing quasi-experimental support for our findings.

### ¶38. Limitations: Movement Interpretation

Our measure of movement, A = |ΔV|, captures positioning change but may reflect multiple underlying phenomena. Movement could indicate: (a) learning and adaptation, our preferred interpretation; (b) investor pressure forcing repositioning; (c) founder indecision rather than strategic adaptation; or (d) measurement noise in our vagueness scores. The large magnitude of the movement effect (2.6×) is too large for measurement noise alone, and the direction irrelevance (focusing ≈ broadening) argues against simple investor pressure explanations. However, we cannot definitively distinguish strategic adaptation from other sources of positioning change.

### ¶39. Limitations: Vagueness Measurement

Our vagueness measure captures positioning breadth rather than communication clarity, strategic intent, or linguistic ambiguity. This measure may not distinguish between deliberate strategic ambiguity and unfocused thinking. Description changes may reflect investor pressure rather than founder strategy. The measure applies only to text-based positioning descriptions and may miss positioning signals conveyed through other channels (product features, team composition, patent filings). Our validation showing orthogonality to readability (r = 0.08) addresses writing quality concerns but does not address strategic intent.

### ¶40. Future Research Directions

Several research directions emerge from our findings. First, causal identification: natural experiments such as exogenous market shocks or policy changes could provide stronger evidence for the causal effect of movement on success. Second, mechanism decomposition: what drives movement, and does the source of movement matter? Distinguishing founder-initiated pivots from investor-demanded pivots would clarify the adaptation mechanism. Third, temporal dynamics: when in a venture's lifecycle does movement matter most? Early movement may differ from late movement in both causes and consequences. Fourth, cross-context validation: our findings cover technology ventures during 2021-2025; generalization to other sectors and time periods requires validation.
