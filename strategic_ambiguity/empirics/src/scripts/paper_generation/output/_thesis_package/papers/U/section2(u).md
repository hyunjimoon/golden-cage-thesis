# Paper U: When Vagueness Pays
## Section 2: Theory (¶16-24)

### ¶16. Signaling Theory as the Null Hypothesis

Signaling theory provides the dominant framework for understanding entrepreneurial communication with investors. Spence (1973) established that credible signals—costly to produce and correlated with unobservable quality—enable high-ability actors to separate themselves from low-ability imitators. Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that precise, verifiable promises reduce information asymmetry and improve venture outcomes (Connelly, Certo, Ireland, & Reutzel, 2011). Founders who articulate specific technologies, measurable milestones, and concrete deliverables enable investors to assess quality directly, separating genuine potential from wishful thinking. In this view, vagueness represents noise: an inferior signal that either masks low ability or invites adverse selection. We formalize this conventional wisdom as our null hypothesis: promise vagueness monotonically reduces venture success.

### ¶17. Strategic Ambiguity as Flexibility Preservation

A contrasting perspective emerges from research on strategic ambiguity in organizational communication. Eisenberg (1984) argues that ambiguity is not merely failed clarity but a deliberate communicative strategy serving multiple functions: promoting unified diversity, preserving future options, and enabling deniability. Sillince, Jarzabkowski, and Shaw (2012) extend this logic to show how organizations deploy ambiguity to manage competing stakeholder demands simultaneously. For entrepreneurs, vagueness may preserve strategic flexibility, support identity formation during market emergence, and reduce premature commitment to narrow niches that may prove unviable (Santos & Eisenhardt, 2009). This perspective suggests that the relationship between vagueness and outcomes may not be uniformly negative; strategic ambiguity may function as an instrument for maintaining degrees of freedom rather than merely degrading signal quality.

### ¶18. Real Options Theory and Entrepreneurial Experimentation

A third stream conceptualizes entrepreneurship as a process of experimentation and learning under uncertainty (McGrath, 1999; Kerr, Nanda, & Rhodes-Kropf, 2014). Real options theory establishes that preserving strategic alternatives has value when the future is unknowable, and that premature commitment destroys this value (Kogut & Kulatilaka, 2001). Bolton and Faure-Grimaud (2010) formalize this intuition in a moral hazard model where entrepreneurs choose an effort allocation parameter that determines how strictly they bind themselves to a specific project path versus retaining flexibility to pivot. We draw on this framework to reinterpret vagueness (V) as a communicative analogue to their commitment parameter: high vagueness preserves optionality but introduces evaluation noise, while low vagueness enables verification but constrains strategic flexibility.

### ¶19. The Gap: Options Without Exercise

Across these literatures, a common but largely untested assumption persists: the effect of vagueness on venture outcomes is monotonically negative. Existing empirical work implicitly treats vagueness as a unidimensional quality indicator that degrades informational content as it increases. Yet this assumption conflicts with the theoretical value of ambiguity documented in organizational communication research, the option-preservation logic of real-options scholarship, and the heterogeneous investor preferences documented in venture capital studies (Bengtsson & Hsu, 2015). Most critically, no prior work tests whether exercising strategic options—movement—matters more than holding options—initial positioning. Real options theory suggests vagueness creates optionality, but options generate value only when exercised at appropriate moments. Our paper addresses this gap.

### ¶20. Positioning Within the Categorical Clarity Literature

Our work engages directly with the literature on categorical positioning and market identity. Zuckerman (1999) established the "categorical imperative": firms spanning multiple categories face valuation penalties because analysts cannot easily evaluate them. Pontikes (2012) nuanced this finding, showing that ambiguous categories can attract resources from certain audiences—particularly venture capitalists seeking novel opportunities—while deterring others. Hsu (2006) demonstrated that investor type moderates signaling effectiveness, with status signals operating differently across VC versus angel contexts. Our contribution extends this literature in three ways. First, we shift from public market penalties (Zuckerman) to early-stage resource acquisition, where evaluation criteria differ fundamentally. Second, we move beyond category spanning to positioning precision—how specifically founders define their category, not how many categories they claim. Third, and most critically, we introduce the Movement Principle: whereas prior work treats positioning as static, we show that adaptation dominates initial positioning as a success predictor. Zuckerman documented penalties for categorical ambiguity; Pontikes showed ambiguity can attract certain investors; we demonstrate that what matters most is neither initial clarity nor ambiguity but whether ventures adapt their positioning over time.

### ¶21. Core Mechanism: Projection and Audience Segmentation

Our theoretical mechanism builds on Eisenberg's (1984) foundational insight that ambiguity serves strategic functions beyond information transmission. Eisenberg identified "unified diversity" as a key benefit: ambiguous messages allow diverse audiences to find their own meaning, creating alignment without requiring agreement on specifics. In entrepreneurial contexts, this translates to what we term the "projection mechanism"—vague positioning allows investors to project their own visions of success onto the venture. Ghemawat (1991) provides the complementary commitment lens: strategic choices create path dependencies that constrain future options, and early capital may function as "sticky factors" that resist redirection. Together, these frameworks suggest that vagueness preserves optionality that precise commitments foreclose. To interpret why the linear assumption may fail, we propose that promise precision functions as a sorting device across heterogeneous investor audiences. Some investors—"Analysts"—prioritize due diligence, verifiable claims, and measurable milestones; for these audiences, precision reduces uncertainty and enables benchmarking. Other investors—"Believers"—prioritize transformative potential and founder vision over near-term verifiability; for these audiences, vagueness indicates scope for growth and openness to adjacent opportunities. As Eisenberg (1984, p. 239) observes: "the more ambiguous the message, the greater the room for projection."

### ¶22. Hypotheses: Monotonicity and Movement

We derive two primary hypotheses and one secondary hypothesis. H₀ (Signaling Null) predicts that vagueness monotonically reduces venture success; we test this with Spearman ρ(V,L), expecting ρ < 0 under the null. H₁ (Non-Monotonic) predicts that the V-L relationship is non-monotonic; ρ ≥ 0 would reject H₀ in favor of H₁. H₂ (Movement Principle) predicts that adaptation matters more than initial positioning; we test whether L(moved) substantially exceeds L(stayed), where "moved" indicates adaptive capacity A > 0. The Analyst/Believer distinction functions as an interpretive mechanism rather than a directly tested moderator.

### ¶23. Alternative Explanations

Several alternative explanations could produce patterns similar to our hypotheses and must be addressed. First, reverse causality: successful ventures might update their descriptions, producing correlation without causal relationship. We address this by using earliest-available positioning snapshots. Second, omitted variables: unobserved founder quality might drive both positioning choices and outcomes. We address this through industry fixed effects and robustness checks with serial entrepreneur indicators. Third, selection effects: conditioning on VC-funded ventures may bias findings. This concern attenuates rather than inflates our estimates, making findings conservative. Fourth, measurement artifacts: our vagueness measure might capture writing quality rather than strategic positioning. We demonstrate orthogonality to readability metrics (correlation with Flesch-Kincaid r = 0.08).

### ¶24. Vagueness Measure Validity

Our vagueness measure requires careful validation, as it is central to all findings. We operationalize vagueness through HybridVaguenessScorerV2, combining categorical term density (presence of vague terms like "platform," "solutions," "innovative") with concreteness deficit based on Brysbaert norms (1 minus average word concreteness). This measure captures positioning breadth—how broadly versus narrowly a venture defines its market and technology—rather than communication clarity or linguistic ambiguity per se. Limitations include: (a) the measure may not capture strategic intent, only revealed positioning; (b) description updates over time may reflect investor pressure rather than founder strategy; (c) the measure may not distinguish between genuine flexibility and lack of focus. We acknowledge these limitations while noting that our measure shows construct validity through expected correlations with industry, funding stage, and geographic location.
