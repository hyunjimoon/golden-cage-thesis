## Chapter 1: Introduction (¶1-8)

The 🩸pain entrepreneurs feel navigating the tension between flexibility and commitment.

### Sections (8 Paragraphs)

|  ¶  | Role                                 | First Sentence                                                                                                                                            | Figures/Tables |
| :-: | :----------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
|  1  | **The Signaling Prescription**       | Conventional wisdom holds that clarity wins: precise positioning reduces information asymmetry and attracts better partners.                              |                |
|  2  | **The Flexibility Imperative**       | Yet in uncertain environments, the ability to adapt is essential—startups that cannot pivot often fail.                                                   |                |
|  3  | **The Empirical Puzzle**             | Analyzing 180,860 technology ventures, we find that success rates vary non-monotonically with vagueness, rejecting the precision prescription.            |                |
|  4  | **The Movement Principle**           | Our most striking finding: companies that adapted (A > 0) succeed 2.6× more than those that stayed fixed—direction matters less than movement.            |                |
|  5  | **The Capital-Flexibility Tradeoff** | Early capital is associated with reduced adaptation (ρ = −0.009***), though this effect is small in magnitude.                                            |                |
|  6  | **The Central Question**             | When does positioning flexibility enable success, and what role does capital play in constraining or enabling adaptation?                                 |                |
|  7  | **Contributions**                    | We offer three contributions: (1) reject monotonic signaling prediction, (2) establish the Movement Principle, (3) document capital-flexibility friction. |                |
|  8  | **Dissertation Structure**           | This thesis presents two empirical papers (U: non-monotonic pattern, C: capital-flexibility tradeoff) and a Discussion synthesizing implications.         |                |

### Key Statistics (Updated with Real Data)

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|:-------|:------|:---------------|
| Total ventures | **180,860** | Technology ventures 2021-2025 |
| Later Stage VC rate | **11.5%** | Base success rate |
| Spearman ρ(V,L) | **+0.024***| Rejects monotonic decrease |
| Movement advantage | **2.6×** | Moved (18.1%) vs Stayed (7.0%) |
| Capital-flexibility | **ρ(A,E) = −0.009***| Small but significant friction |
| Adaptation → Growth | **ρ(G,A) = +0.044***| Moderate positive effect |

### Central Question
> When does positioning flexibility enable adaptation, and how does early capital affect the ability to exercise strategic options?

### Key Findings Summary
1. **Non-monotonic pattern**: Signaling theory's monotonic prediction rejected (Spearman ρ > 0)
2. **Movement Principle**: Companies that adapted succeed 2.6× more than those that stayed fixed
3. **Direction irrelevance**: Focusing (17.6%) ≈ Broadening (18.6%) among movers
4. **Capital-flexibility friction**: Statistically significant but economically small (ρ = −0.009)
5. **Vagueness buys options—USE THEM**: The value lies in exercising options, not just holding them
