\section{Synthesis of Findings}
\label{sec:synthesis}

\subsection*{Integration of Paper U and Paper C}

This dissertation has documented two main empirical findings across Papers U and C. Paper U establishes the Movement Principle: among 180,860 technology ventures, those that repositioned ($A > 0$) succeed at 18.1\% compared to 7.0\% for stayers---a 2.6$\times$ advantage that dominates any effect of initial positioning. The non-monotonic relationship between vagueness and success ($\rho = +0.024^{***}$) rejects signaling theory's monotonic prediction. Paper C documents a capital-flexibility friction: early capital is associated with reduced adaptation ($\rho = -0.009^{***}$), though the effect is economically small, explaining less than 1\% of the Capital Paradox. Together, these findings suggest that strategic vagueness creates options, but exercising options through adaptation matters most.

\subsection*{The Movement Principle as Core Contribution}

The Movement Principle emerges as this dissertation's most robust and economically significant finding. The 2.6$\times$ success advantage for movers over stayers substantially exceeds any other effect documented in our analyses. This finding reframes debates about positioning strategy: the question is not ``what position is best'' but ``does the venture adapt.'' The Q3 anomaly---where ventures with intermediate-high vagueness show the highest success---dissolves entirely when decomposed by movement: Q3 has the highest movement rate (68\%), and among stayers only, Q3 shows the lowest success (6.6\%). Aggregate patterns mask the fundamental importance of adaptation. Our contribution extends beyond \citeauthor{zuckerman1999}'s (\citeyear{zuckerman1999}) categorical penalty and \citeauthor{pontikes2012}'s (\citeyear{pontikes2012}) audience-dependent effects: while they examine static positioning, we show that dynamic repositioning is the first-order distinction. \citeauthor{eisenberg1984}'s (\citeyear{eisenberg1984}) ``unified diversity'' mechanism explains why vagueness enables projection; \citeauthor{ghemawat1991}'s (\citeyear{ghemawat1991}) commitment framework explains why capital constrains repositioning. The Movement Principle synthesizes these insights: vagueness preserves options, but option exercise---not option holding---drives success.

\subsection*{The Capital-Flexibility Tradeoff as Suggestive Finding}

In contrast to the Movement Principle, the capital-flexibility tradeoff is a suggestive rather than strong finding. The correlation $\rho(A,E) = -0.009$ is statistically significant but economically small. The strong negative $E$-$L$ correlation ($\rho = -0.211^{***}$) remains largely unexplained by flexibility friction. We present this finding as evidence that capital may create friction against adaptation, while acknowledging that other mechanisms---market selection, overfunding, expectation management---likely dominate the Capital Paradox. Claims about ``golden cages'' or ``commitment traps'' should be tempered by these small effect sizes.

\subsection*{Unified Framework}

We synthesize findings into a unified framework: vagueness creates options ($V \rightarrow A$ potential), capital may constrain option exercise ($E \rightarrow -A$, small effect), and exercising options creates value ($A \rightarrow L$, large effect). The practical implication is that entrepreneurs should prioritize securing flexibility through initial positioning and then commit to adaptation as conditions warrant. The strategic value lies not in holding options but in exercising them. Static positioning---whether precise or vague---substantially underperforms adaptive positioning.

%% ====================
\section{Practical Implications}
\label{sec:implications}

\subsection*{Implications for Entrepreneurs}

For entrepreneurs, our findings suggest three priorities. First, secure positioning flexibility early: moderate-to-high initial vagueness may create room to adapt without foreclosing specific opportunities. Second, commit to adaptation: the 2.6$\times$ Movement Principle effect suggests that repositioning, rather than initial positioning optimization, should be the primary focus. Third, do not blame capital for inflexibility: the capital-flexibility friction ($\rho = -0.009$) is too small to be a binding constraint. If a venture is not adapting, the constraint is probably founder beliefs, market signals, or team capabilities rather than capital-induced rigidity.

\subsection*{Implications for Investors}

For investors, our findings suggest tracking adaptation as a key signal. Ventures that demonstrate repositioning---regardless of direction---succeed at substantially higher rates than those that stay fixed. This suggests: monitoring portfolio company positioning changes over time; interpreting positioning shifts as potentially positive rather than concerning; and considering how investment terms might affect founder willingness to adapt. The Movement Principle also suggests caution about over-specifying milestones that might discourage beneficial pivots, though the small capital-flexibility friction suggests this concern should not be overstated.

\subsection*{Implications for Policymakers}

For policymakers supporting entrepreneurial ecosystems, our findings suggest that policies should not penalize strategic repositioning. Grant structures or reporting requirements that treat pivots as failures may discourage the adaptation that predicts success. More broadly, the Movement Principle suggests that policies supporting experimentation and iteration may be more valuable than policies requiring precise upfront commitments. However, given our correlational design, policy implications should be considered exploratory rather than definitive.

\subsection*{Limitations of Practical Guidance}

We acknowledge limitations in translating our findings to practice. The correlational nature of our evidence means we cannot guarantee that interventions to increase adaptation will improve outcomes. The movement effect may reflect selection (adaptable founders also succeed more) rather than causation (adaptation causes success). Our findings cover technology ventures during 2021--2025; other contexts may differ. Practitioners should treat our findings as suggestive guidance rather than proven prescriptions.

%% ====================
%% SECTION 3: LIMITATIONS
%% ====================
\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

\subsection*{Correlational Design and Causal Identification}

Our primary limitation is the correlational nature of our evidence. We document associations between vagueness, movement, capital, and success, but cannot establish causation. The Movement Principle may reflect reverse causality (successful ventures have resources to reposition), selection effects (certain founders both adapt more and succeed more), or omitted variables (market dynamism drives both). The capital-flexibility friction faces similar challenges: we cannot distinguish commitment costs from selection effects. However, we provide quasi-experimental evidence through temporal stability analysis: our key relationships maintain consistent signs and significance across three distinct market regimes (post-COVID 2023, AI boom 2024, market maturation 2025). If omitted variables or selection effects drove our results, we would expect coefficient instability across these heterogeneous conditions. The observed stability---$\rho(A,E)$ negative across all years, $\rho(G,A)$ positive across all years, $\rho(G,E)$ negative across all years---provides evidence that our findings reflect stable structural relationships rather than period-specific confounds. Future research should pursue natural experiments or instrumental variables for stronger causal identification.

\subsection*{Vagueness Measure Validity}

Our vagueness measure captures positioning breadth rather than strategic intent, communication quality, or linguistic ambiguity. The measure may not distinguish deliberate strategic ambiguity from unfocused thinking. It applies only to text-based descriptions and may miss positioning signals in other channels. Description changes may reflect investor pressure rather than founder strategy. While we demonstrate orthogonality to readability metrics ($r = 0.08$) and expected correlations with industry and stage, these validations do not address strategic intent. Future research should develop multi-dimensional measures incorporating pitch decks, patent claims, and product features.

\subsection*{Alternative Explanations}

Several alternative explanations could account for our findings. The Movement Principle may reflect founder quality: highly capable founders both adapt more effectively and succeed more frequently. The Q3 anomaly explanation via movement rates may mask other factors correlated with both vagueness and movement propensity. The small capital-flexibility friction may understate true effects if our measures are noisy or if effects are heterogeneous. We address alternative explanations through robustness checks and transparent reporting, but cannot definitively rule them out.

\subsection*{Generalizability}

Our findings cover technology ventures receiving early-stage funding during 2021--2025, a period of significant market volatility including post-COVID recovery and generative AI emergence. Results may not generalize to other sectors (where positioning dynamics differ), other time periods (particularly stable market conditions), other geographic contexts (our data are primarily U.S.-focused), or other stages of development (our focus on early-stage may not apply to later stages). Future research should test boundary conditions across contexts.

\section{Future Research}
\label{sec:future}

\subsection*{Causal Identification Research}

The most pressing need is stronger causal evidence for the Movement Principle and capital-flexibility relationships. Natural experiments could exploit exogenous shocks---policy changes, major technology shifts, investor fund closures---to identify causal effects. Instrumental variable approaches could use factors affecting positioning or capital that are plausibly unrelated to unobserved venture quality. Field experiments manipulating information or incentives could directly test causal mechanisms.

\subsection*{Mechanism Decomposition Research}

Future research should decompose mechanisms underlying our aggregate findings. For the Movement Principle: what drives movement, and does movement source matter? Distinguishing founder-initiated pivots from investor-demanded pivots would clarify whether adaptation per se causes success or whether it proxies for founder capability. For the Capital Paradox: what mechanisms explain the strong $E$-$L$ negative correlation beyond flexibility friction? Testing market selection, overfunding, and expectation mechanisms would advance understanding.

\subsection*{Heterogeneity Research}

Our findings present aggregate effects that may mask important heterogeneity. Under what conditions is the Movement Principle strongest or weakest? Do certain founder characteristics, market conditions, or venture types moderate the movement-success relationship? Under what conditions is capital-flexibility friction stronger? Identifying moderators would enable more targeted practical guidance.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

This dissertation establishes that strategic adaptation---movement---dominates initial positioning as a predictor of venture success. Among 180,860 technology ventures, those that repositioned succeed 2.6$\times$ more often than those that stayed fixed, an effect substantially larger than any positioning or capital effect. The practical implication is stark: vagueness buys options, but options must be exercised. Entrepreneurs should prioritize securing flexibility early and committing to adaptation as conditions warrant. The question is not ``what position is best'' but ``does the venture adapt.'' Movement matters more than where you start or where you end up.
