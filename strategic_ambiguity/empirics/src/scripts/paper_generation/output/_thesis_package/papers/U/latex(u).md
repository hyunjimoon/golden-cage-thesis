\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:u-intro}

\subsection*{The Signaling Prescription}

Signaling theory provides the dominant framework for understanding how entrepreneurs communicate with investors. \citet{spence1973} established that credible signals---costly to produce and correlated with unobservable quality---enable high-ability actors to separate themselves from low-ability imitators. Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that precise, verifiable promises reduce information asymmetry and improve venture outcomes. Founders who articulate specific technologies, measurable milestones, and concrete deliverables enable investors to assess quality directly. The ``scientific approach'' to entrepreneurship extends this logic, prescribing that founders formulate falsifiable hypotheses, gather evidence, and refine strategy based on validated learning \citep{stern2021, gans2019}. We formalize this conventional wisdom as our null hypothesis: promise vagueness monotonically reduces venture success.

\subsection*{The Empirical Puzzle}

Our analysis of 180,860 technology ventures reveals a pattern that challenges this prescription. Success rates---measured as progression to Later Stage VC funding---do not decrease monotonically with positioning vagueness. The Spearman rank correlation between initial vagueness ($V$) and later success ($L$) is $\rho = +0.024$ ($p < 0.001$), directly contradicting the negative correlation predicted by signaling theory. Success rates by quartile show Q1 (precise) at 12.3\%, Q2 at 8.9\%, Q3 at 16.0\%, and Q4 (vague) at 12.9\%. The highest success rate appears in Q3, not at either extreme---a pattern inconsistent with both signaling theory's monotonic prediction and simple strategic ambiguity arguments that would favor Q4.

\subsection*{Research Question}

This paper asks: when does positioning vagueness become valuable, and why does the relationship between vagueness and success appear non-monotonic? We test two competing predictions: signaling theory's null hypothesis that vagueness monotonically reduces success ($H_0$), and an alternative hypothesis that the relationship is non-monotonic ($H_1$). More importantly, we examine whether strategic repositioning---movement---matters more than initial positioning. If vagueness creates options but options require exercise to generate value, then adaptation should predict success better than initial position.

\subsection*{The Movement Principle}

Our most striking finding resolves the Q3 anomaly: what matters is not initial positioning but whether ventures adapt. Companies that repositioned (adaptive capacity $A > 0$) succeed at 18.1\%, compared to 7.0\% for those that stayed fixed---a 2.6$\times$ advantage. Q3's high aggregate success (16.0\%) is entirely explained by its high movement rate (68\%); among stayers only, Q3 has the lowest success (6.6\%). Direction matters little: focusing ($D < 0$) yields 17.6\% success while broadening ($D > 0$) yields 18.6\%. We term this the \textit{Movement Principle}: vagueness buys options, but exercising options---not holding them---drives success.

\subsection*{Theoretical Framework}

We draw on real options theory \citep{mcgrath1999} and strategic ambiguity research \citep{eisenberg1984} to interpret our findings. Vague positioning may function as a portfolio of strategic options, preserving flexibility to respond when uncertainty resolves. However, options have value only when exercised at appropriate moments. The Movement Principle suggests that the ``option exercise'' component---adaptation---dominates the ``option holding'' component---initial positioning. This reframes the vagueness debate from ``what position is best'' to ``does the firm adapt when conditions warrant.''

\subsection*{Contributions}

This paper offers three contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, we reject signaling theory's monotonic prediction: the positive Spearman correlation ($\rho = +0.024^{***}$) contradicts the assumption that vagueness always degrades outcomes. Second, we establish the Movement Principle: adaptation predicts success 2.6$\times$ better than staying fixed, dominating any positioning effect. Third, we explain the Q3 anomaly through differential movement rates, demonstrating that aggregate success rates can be misleading when movement propensities vary across positioning categories.

\subsection*{Paper Structure}

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section~\ref{sec:u-theory} develops the theoretical framework, reviewing signaling theory, strategic ambiguity, and real options to derive testable hypotheses. Section~\ref{sec:u-empirics} presents our empirical approach, describing the data, variables, and identification strategy. Section~\ref{sec:u-discussion} reports results, documents the non-monotonic pattern and Movement Principle, discusses implications, acknowledges limitations, and proposes future research directions.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:u-theory}

\subsection*{Signaling Theory as the Null Hypothesis}

Signaling theory provides the dominant framework for understanding entrepreneurial communication with investors. \citet{spence1973} established that credible signals---costly to produce and correlated with unobservable quality---enable high-ability actors to separate themselves from low-ability imitators. Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that precise, verifiable promises reduce information asymmetry and improve venture outcomes \citep{connelly2011}. Founders who articulate specific technologies, measurable milestones, and concrete deliverables enable investors to assess quality directly, separating genuine potential from wishful thinking. In this view, vagueness represents noise: an inferior signal that either masks low ability or invites adverse selection. We formalize this conventional wisdom as our null hypothesis: promise vagueness monotonically reduces venture success.

\subsection*{Strategic Ambiguity as Flexibility Preservation}

A contrasting perspective emerges from research on strategic ambiguity in organizational communication. \citet{eisenberg1984} argues that ambiguity is not merely failed clarity but a deliberate communicative strategy serving multiple functions: promoting unified diversity, preserving future options, and enabling deniability. \citet{sillince2012} extend this logic to show how organizations deploy ambiguity to manage competing stakeholder demands simultaneously. For entrepreneurs, vagueness may preserve strategic flexibility, support identity formation during market emergence, and reduce premature commitment to narrow niches that may prove unviable \citep{santos2009}. This perspective suggests that the relationship between vagueness and outcomes may not be uniformly negative; strategic ambiguity may function as an instrument for maintaining degrees of freedom rather than merely degrading signal quality.

\subsection*{Real Options Theory and Entrepreneurial Experimentation}

A third stream conceptualizes entrepreneurship as a process of experimentation and learning under uncertainty \citep{mcgrath1999, kerr2014}. Real options theory establishes that preserving strategic alternatives has value when the future is unknowable, and that premature commitment destroys this value \citep{kogut2001}. \citet{bolton2010} formalize this intuition in a moral hazard model where entrepreneurs choose an effort allocation parameter that determines how strictly they bind themselves to a specific project path versus retaining flexibility to pivot. We draw on this framework to reinterpret vagueness ($V$) as a communicative analogue to their commitment parameter: high vagueness preserves optionality but introduces evaluation noise, while low vagueness enables verification but constrains strategic flexibility.

\subsection*{The Gap: Options Without Exercise}

Across these literatures, a common but largely untested assumption persists: the effect of vagueness on venture outcomes is monotonically negative. Existing empirical work implicitly treats vagueness as a unidimensional quality indicator that degrades informational content as it increases. Yet this assumption conflicts with the theoretical value of ambiguity documented in organizational communication research, the option-preservation logic of real-options scholarship, and the heterogeneous investor preferences documented in venture capital studies \citep{bengtsson2015}. Most critically, no prior work tests whether exercising strategic options---movement---matters more than holding options---initial positioning. Real options theory suggests vagueness creates optionality, but options generate value only when exercised at appropriate moments. Our paper addresses this gap.

\subsection*{Positioning Within the Categorical Clarity Literature}

Our work engages directly with the literature on categorical positioning and market identity. \citet{zuckerman1999} established the ``categorical imperative'': firms spanning multiple categories face valuation penalties because analysts cannot easily evaluate them. \citet{pontikes2012} nuanced this finding, showing that ambiguous categories can attract resources from certain audiences---particularly venture capitalists seeking novel opportunities---while deterring others. \citet{hsu2006} demonstrated that investor type moderates signaling effectiveness, with status signals operating differently across VC versus angel contexts. Our contribution extends this literature in three ways. First, we shift from public market penalties (Zuckerman) to early-stage resource acquisition, where evaluation criteria differ fundamentally. Second, we move beyond category spanning to positioning precision---how specifically founders define their category, not how many categories they claim. Third, and most critically, we introduce the Movement Principle: whereas prior work treats positioning as static, we show that adaptation dominates initial positioning as a success predictor.

\subsection*{Core Mechanism: Projection and Audience Segmentation}

Our theoretical mechanism builds on \citeauthor{eisenberg1984}'s (\citeyear{eisenberg1984}) foundational insight that ambiguity serves strategic functions beyond information transmission. Eisenberg identified ``unified diversity'' as a key benefit: ambiguous messages allow diverse audiences to find their own meaning, creating alignment without requiring agreement on specifics. In entrepreneurial contexts, this translates to what we term the ``projection mechanism''---vague positioning allows investors to project their own visions of success onto the venture. \citet{ghemawat1991} provides the complementary commitment lens: strategic choices create path dependencies that constrain future options, and early capital may function as ``sticky factors'' that resist redirection. Together, these frameworks suggest that vagueness preserves optionality that precise commitments foreclose. To interpret why the linear assumption may fail, we propose that promise precision functions as a sorting device across heterogeneous investor audiences. Some investors---``Analysts''---prioritize due diligence, verifiable claims, and measurable milestones; for these audiences, precision reduces uncertainty and enables benchmarking. Other investors---``Believers''---prioritize transformative potential and founder vision over near-term verifiability; for these audiences, vagueness indicates scope for growth and openness to adjacent opportunities.

\subsection*{Hypotheses: Monotonicity and Movement}

We derive two primary hypotheses and one secondary hypothesis. $H_0$ (Signaling Null) predicts that vagueness monotonically reduces venture success; we test this with Spearman $\rho(V,L)$, expecting $\rho < 0$ under the null. $H_1$ (Non-Monotonic) predicts that the $V$-$L$ relationship is non-monotonic; $\rho \geq 0$ would reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$. $H_2$ (Movement Principle) predicts that adaptation matters more than initial positioning; we test whether $L(\text{moved})$ substantially exceeds $L(\text{stayed})$, where ``moved'' indicates adaptive capacity $A > 0$. The Analyst/Believer distinction functions as an interpretive mechanism rather than a directly tested moderator.

\subsection*{Alternative Explanations}

Several alternative explanations could produce patterns similar to our hypotheses and must be addressed. First, reverse causality: successful ventures might update their descriptions, producing correlation without causal relationship. We address this by using earliest-available positioning snapshots. Second, omitted variables: unobserved founder quality might drive both positioning choices and outcomes. We address this through industry fixed effects and robustness checks with serial entrepreneur indicators. Third, selection effects: conditioning on VC-funded ventures may bias findings. This concern attenuates rather than inflates our estimates, making findings conservative. Fourth, measurement artifacts: our vagueness measure might capture writing quality rather than strategic positioning. We demonstrate orthogonality to readability metrics (correlation with Flesch-Kincaid $r = 0.08$).

\subsection*{Vagueness Measure Validity}

Our vagueness measure requires careful validation, as it is central to all findings. We operationalize vagueness through HybridVaguenessScorerV2, combining categorical term density (presence of vague terms like ``platform,'' ``solutions,'' ``innovative'') with concreteness deficit based on Brysbaert norms (1 minus average word concreteness). This measure captures positioning breadth---how broadly versus narrowly a venture defines its market and technology---rather than communication clarity or linguistic ambiguity per se. Limitations include: (a) the measure may not capture strategic intent, only revealed positioning; (b) description updates over time may reflect investor pressure rather than founder strategy; (c) the measure may not distinguish between genuine flexibility and lack of focus.

%% ====================
%% SECTION 3: EMPIRICS
%% ====================
\section{Empirics}
\label{sec:u-empirics}

\subsection*{Data and Sample Construction}

We analyze technology ventures using PitchBook data covering 2021 to 2025. Our sample includes ventures that received early-stage funding (seed or Series A) and for which we can observe positioning descriptions and subsequent funding outcomes. The final sample comprises 180,860 ventures with complete data on initial vagueness scores and later success indicators. This sample represents technology ventures across multiple sectors, providing broad coverage of the startup ecosystem during a period of significant market volatility including the post-COVID recovery and the emergence of generative AI.

\subsection*{Dependent Variable: Long-term Success}

Our primary outcome variable, $L$, captures whether a venture achieves later-stage funding success. We define $L = 1$ if the venture's last financing deal type equals ``Later Stage VC,'' indicating progression beyond early-stage funding to more substantial institutional investment. The base rate in our sample is $L = 11.5\%$, reflecting that most early-stage ventures do not progress to later stages. This binary measure provides a clear threshold for success while avoiding the complications of continuous funding amounts that vary substantially by sector and time period.

\subsection*{Independent Variable: Initial Vagueness}

Our primary explanatory variable, $V$, measures the vagueness of a venture's initial market positioning using HybridVaguenessScorerV2. The score ranges from 0 (maximally precise) to 100 (maximally vague) and combines two components with equal weight: categorical term density, measuring the presence of vague categorical terms such as ``platform,'' ``solutions,'' and ``innovative''; and concreteness deficit, measuring 1 minus average word concreteness based on Brysbaert psycholinguistic norms. This measure captures positioning breadth rather than communication quality, distinguishing it from readability metrics. The correlation between our vagueness score and Flesch-Kincaid readability is $r = 0.08$, indicating that vagueness and writing quality are largely orthogonal.

\subsection*{Key Variable: Adaptive Capacity}

We introduce adaptive capacity, $A = |D| = |V_T - V_0|$, as our measure of strategic movement. $D$ captures directional change (signed), while $A$ captures absolute change regardless of direction. We classify ventures as ``stayed'' ($A = 0$) if their positioning remained fixed, and ``moved'' ($A > 0$) if they repositioned over time. In our sample, 60\% of ventures show $A = 0$ (stayed) while 40\% repositioned (moved). This measure captures revealed adaptation rather than underlying capacity, as we observe positioning changes but not the ability to change.

\subsection*{Identification Strategy and Temporal Robustness}

Our primary identification strategy relies on Spearman rank correlation to test monotonicity, avoiding parametric assumptions about functional form. For the Movement Principle, we compare success rates between movers and stayers using chi-squared tests. We acknowledge that our design is correlational: we document associations between vagueness, movement, and success but cannot establish causation. However, we strengthen causal inference through temporal stability analysis---a quasi-natural experiment exploiting variation across distinct market regimes. If our relationships were driven by omitted variables or spurious correlations, we would expect coefficient instability across the post-COVID recovery (2023), the AI boom (2024), and continued market evolution (2025). Instead, we observe remarkable stability: the capital-flexibility friction ($\rho(A,E)$) remains negative and significant across all three years ($-0.007^{**}$ in 2023, $-0.006^{*}$ in 2024, $-0.009^{***}$ in 2025), the flexibility-growth relationship ($\rho(G,A)$) remains positive and significant ($+0.033^{***}$ to $+0.044^{***}$), and the capital paradox ($\rho(G,E)$) remains strongly negative ($-0.225^{***}$ to $-0.211^{***}$). This temporal stability across heterogeneous market conditions provides evidence against the omitted variable and selection explanations that would produce unstable coefficients.

\subsection*{Results: Rejecting Monotonicity}

The Spearman rank correlation between initial vagueness ($V$) and later success ($L$) is $\rho = +0.024$ ($p < 0.001$). This positive correlation directly rejects signaling theory's prediction of monotonic decrease: under $H_0$, we expected $\rho < 0$. Success rates by quartile show Q1 (precise) at 12.3\%, Q2 at 8.9\%, Q3 at 16.0\%, and Q4 (vague) at 12.9\%. The pattern is non-monotonic rather than U-shaped: Q3 exceeds both Q1 and Q4, contrary to what either pure signaling or pure strategic ambiguity arguments would predict. We therefore reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_1$: the relationship between vagueness and success is non-monotonic.

\subsection*{Results: The Movement Principle}

Our most striking finding concerns the role of adaptation. Companies that repositioned ($A > 0$) succeed at 18.1\%, compared to 7.0\% for those that stayed fixed---a 2.6$\times$ advantage ($\chi^2 = 4{,}891.3$, $p < 0.001$). This movement effect dominates any positioning effect. Decomposing by quartile and movement status reveals that Q3's high aggregate success (16.0\%) is entirely explained by its high movement rate (68\%). Among stayers only, Q3 has the lowest success (6.6\%), while Q2 has the highest (7.5\%). Among movers, Q3 shows the highest success (20.4\%). The aggregate pattern masks fundamentally different dynamics for movers versus stayers.

\subsection*{Results: Direction Irrelevance}

Among movers ($A > 0$), direction matters little. Those who focused ($D < 0$, moving toward more precision) succeed at 17.6\%, while those who broadened ($D > 0$, moving toward more vagueness) succeed at 18.6\%. The chi-squared test yields $\chi^2 = 12.4$ ($p = 0.0004$), indicating statistical significance, but the economic magnitude is trivial: a 1.0 percentage point difference versus the 11.1 percentage point difference between movers and stayers. The movement advantage (2.6$\times$) is approximately 25 times larger than the direction effect. This supports the Movement Principle: what matters is whether ventures adapt, not in which direction they move.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:u-discussion}

\subsection*{Summary of Findings}

This paper documents three main findings from our analysis of 180,860 technology ventures. First, we reject signaling theory's monotonic prediction: the Spearman correlation between vagueness and success is $\rho = +0.024$ ($p < 0.001$), positive rather than the negative value predicted under the signaling null. Second, we establish the Movement Principle: ventures that repositioned succeed at 18.1\% compared to 7.0\% for those that stayed fixed, a 2.6$\times$ advantage that dominates any positioning effect. Third, we resolve the Q3 anomaly by showing that differential movement rates, not positioning per se, explain aggregate success patterns across vagueness quartiles.

\subsection*{Theoretical Implications}

These findings reframe the vagueness debate from positioning to adaptation. Traditional signaling theory and strategic ambiguity arguments both focus on initial positioning---where to start on the precision-vagueness spectrum. Our evidence suggests this framing is incomplete. Vagueness may create strategic options, consistent with real options theory \citep{mcgrath1999}, but options generate value only when exercised. The Movement Principle suggests that the exercise component dominates the holding component. This interpretation reconciles signaling theory (which favors precision) with strategic ambiguity (which favors vagueness) by identifying a third factor---adaptation---that matters more than either extreme. Importantly, our contribution extends beyond \citeauthor{zuckerman1999}'s (\citeyear{zuckerman1999}) categorical penalty and \citeauthor{pontikes2012}'s (\citeyear{pontikes2012}) audience-dependent effects by showing that static versus dynamic positioning is the first-order distinction.

\subsection*{Practical Implications for Entrepreneurs}

For entrepreneurs, our findings suggest prioritizing adaptation over initial positioning optimization. The 2.6$\times$ success advantage for movers over stayers substantially exceeds any advantage from positioning at a particular vagueness level. Entrepreneurs should: (a) secure positioning flexibility early, which may favor moderate-to-high initial vagueness; (b) commit to adaptation as conditions warrant, as movement itself predicts success; and (c) avoid optimizing initial positioning at the expense of future adaptability. The worst outcome in our data is not wrong positioning but static positioning: among stayers, even the best-positioned quartile (Q2 at 7.5\%) substantially underperforms movers in the worst-positioned quartile (Q2 movers at 16.1\%).

\subsection*{Practical Implications for Investors}

For investors, our findings suggest tracking repositioning as a positive signal. Ventures that demonstrate adaptation may be more likely to succeed regardless of their initial positioning. This suggests: (a) monitoring portfolio company positioning changes over time; (b) interpreting positioning shifts as potentially positive rather than concerning; and (c) considering how investment terms affect founder willingness to adapt. The Movement Principle also suggests caution about over-specifying milestones that might discourage beneficial pivots.

\subsection*{Limitations: Correlational Design}

Our primary limitation is the correlational nature of our evidence. We document associations between vagueness, movement, and success, but cannot establish causation. Movers may differ systematically from stayers in unobserved ways---founder quality, market conditions, investor networks---that drive both adaptation and success. The 2.6$\times$ movement advantage could reflect reverse causality (ventures on success trajectories have resources to reposition), selection effects (certain founder types both adapt more and succeed more), or omitted variables (market dynamism drives both movement and success). We mitigate these concerns through temporal stability analysis: if omitted variables or selection drove our results, we would expect coefficient instability across the distinct market regimes of 2023--2025. Instead, all key relationships maintain consistent sign and significance across years (see Figure~\ref{fig:robustness}), providing quasi-experimental support for our findings.

\subsection*{Limitations: Movement Interpretation}

Our measure of movement, $A = |\Delta V|$, captures positioning change but may reflect multiple underlying phenomena. Movement could indicate: (a) learning and adaptation, our preferred interpretation; (b) investor pressure forcing repositioning; (c) founder indecision rather than strategic adaptation; or (d) measurement noise in our vagueness scores. The large magnitude of the movement effect (2.6$\times$) is too large for measurement noise alone, and the direction irrelevance (focusing $\approx$ broadening) argues against simple investor pressure explanations. However, we cannot definitively distinguish strategic adaptation from other sources of positioning change.

\subsection*{Limitations: Vagueness Measurement}

Our vagueness measure captures positioning breadth rather than communication clarity, strategic intent, or linguistic ambiguity. This measure may not distinguish between deliberate strategic ambiguity and unfocused thinking. Description changes may reflect investor pressure rather than founder strategy. The measure applies only to text-based positioning descriptions and may miss positioning signals conveyed through other channels (product features, team composition, patent filings). Our validation showing orthogonality to readability ($r = 0.08$) addresses writing quality concerns but does not address strategic intent.

\subsection*{Future Research Directions}

Several research directions emerge from our findings. First, causal identification: natural experiments such as exogenous market shocks or policy changes could provide stronger evidence for the causal effect of movement on success. Second, mechanism decomposition: what drives movement, and does the source of movement matter? Distinguishing founder-initiated pivots from investor-demanded pivots would clarify the adaptation mechanism. Third, temporal dynamics: when in a venture's lifecycle does movement matter most? Early movement may differ from late movement in both causes and consequences. Fourth, cross-context validation: our findings cover technology ventures during 2021--2025; generalization to other sectors and time periods requires validation.
