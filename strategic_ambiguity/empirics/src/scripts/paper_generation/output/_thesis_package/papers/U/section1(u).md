# Paper U: When Vagueness Pays
## Section 1: Introduction (¶9-15)

### ¶9. The Signaling Prescription

Signaling theory provides the dominant framework for understanding how entrepreneurs communicate with investors. Spence (1973) established that credible signals—costly to produce and correlated with unobservable quality—enable high-ability actors to separate themselves from low-ability imitators. Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that precise, verifiable promises reduce information asymmetry and improve venture outcomes. Founders who articulate specific technologies, measurable milestones, and concrete deliverables enable investors to assess quality directly. The "scientific approach" to entrepreneurship extends this logic, prescribing that founders formulate falsifiable hypotheses, gather evidence, and refine strategy based on validated learning (Stern & Camuffo, 2021; Gans, Stern, & Wu, 2019). We formalize this conventional wisdom as our null hypothesis: promise vagueness monotonically reduces venture success.

### ¶10. The Empirical Puzzle

Our analysis of 180,860 technology ventures reveals a pattern that challenges this prescription. Success rates—measured as progression to Later Stage VC funding—do not decrease monotonically with positioning vagueness. The Spearman rank correlation between initial vagueness (V) and later success (L) is ρ = +0.024 (p < 0.001), directly contradicting the negative correlation predicted by signaling theory. Success rates by quartile show Q1 (precise) at 12.3%, Q2 at 8.9%, Q3 at 16.0%, and Q4 (vague) at 12.9%. The highest success rate appears in Q3, not at either extreme—a pattern inconsistent with both signaling theory's monotonic prediction and simple strategic ambiguity arguments that would favor Q4.

### ¶11. Research Question

This paper asks: when does positioning vagueness become valuable, and why does the relationship between vagueness and success appear non-monotonic? We test two competing predictions: signaling theory's null hypothesis that vagueness monotonically reduces success (H₀), and an alternative hypothesis that the relationship is non-monotonic (H₁). More importantly, we examine whether strategic repositioning—movement—matters more than initial positioning. If vagueness creates options but options require exercise to generate value, then adaptation should predict success better than initial position.

### ¶12. The Movement Principle

Our most striking finding resolves the Q3 anomaly: what matters is not initial positioning but whether ventures adapt. Companies that repositioned (adaptive capacity A > 0) succeed at 18.1%, compared to 7.0% for those that stayed fixed—a 2.6× advantage. Q3's high aggregate success (16.0%) is entirely explained by its high movement rate (68%); among stayers only, Q3 has the lowest success (6.6%). Direction matters little: focusing (D < 0) yields 17.6% success while broadening (D > 0) yields 18.6%. We term this the Movement Principle: vagueness buys options, but exercising options—not holding them—drives success.

### ¶13. Theoretical Framework

We draw on real options theory (McGrath, 1999) and strategic ambiguity research (Eisenberg, 1984) to interpret our findings. Vague positioning may function as a portfolio of strategic options, preserving flexibility to respond when uncertainty resolves. However, options have value only when exercised at appropriate moments. The Movement Principle suggests that the "option exercise" component—adaptation—dominates the "option holding" component—initial positioning. This reframes the vagueness debate from "what position is best" to "does the firm adapt when conditions warrant."

### ¶14. Contributions

This paper offers three contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, we reject signaling theory's monotonic prediction: the positive Spearman correlation (ρ = +0.024***) contradicts the assumption that vagueness always degrades outcomes. Second, we establish the Movement Principle: adaptation predicts success 2.6× better than staying fixed, dominating any positioning effect. Third, we explain the Q3 anomaly through differential movement rates, demonstrating that aggregate success rates can be misleading when movement propensities vary across positioning categories.

### ¶15. Paper Structure

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the theoretical framework, reviewing signaling theory, strategic ambiguity, and real options to derive testable hypotheses. Section 3 presents our empirical approach, describing the data, variables, and identification strategy. Section 4 reports results, documenting the non-monotonic pattern and Movement Principle. Section 5 discusses implications, acknowledges limitations including alternative explanations and measurement validity, and proposes future research directions.
