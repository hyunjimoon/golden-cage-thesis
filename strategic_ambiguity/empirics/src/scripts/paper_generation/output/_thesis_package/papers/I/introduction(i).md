# Chapter 1: Introduction

## ¶1. The Signaling Prescription

Conventional wisdom in entrepreneurial finance holds that precise positioning attracts better partners and improves venture outcomes. Signaling theory, originating with Spence (1973), establishes that costly, verifiable signals enable high-quality actors to separate themselves from low-quality imitators. Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that founders who articulate specific technologies, measurable milestones, and concrete deliverables reduce information asymmetry with investors (Stern & Camuffo, 2021). The prescription appears straightforward: clarity beats ambiguity. Entrepreneurs should define narrow market categories, specify target customers, and project concrete revenue trajectories. This "scientific approach" to entrepreneurship—formulating falsifiable hypotheses and gathering evidence—has become the dominant paradigm in both academic research and practitioner advice (Gans, Stern, & Wu, 2019).

## ¶2. The Flexibility Imperative

Yet entrepreneurs also face an imperative for strategic flexibility, particularly under conditions of technological and market uncertainty. Real options theory establishes that preserving strategic alternatives has value when the future is unknowable (McGrath, 1999; Kogut & Kulatilaka, 2001). Technology pivots, regulatory shifts, and market evolution create conditions where the "right" strategy cannot be determined in advance. Tesla's deliberately broad positioning—"accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"—allowed repeated pivots across vehicles, batteries, and energy storage while maintaining investor confidence. Better Place, by contrast, committed to a specific battery-swapping infrastructure and failed catastrophically when technology evolved differently than anticipated. The tension is fundamental: the precise commitments that secure early resources may foreclose the strategic adaptations that enable long-term success.

## ¶3. The Empirical Puzzle

Analyzing 180,860 technology ventures that received early-stage funding between 2021 and 2025, we find a pattern that challenges the signaling prescription. Success rates—measured as progression to Later Stage VC funding—vary non-monotonically with initial positioning vagueness. A Spearman rank correlation of ρ(V,L) = +0.024 (p < 0.001) directly contradicts the monotonic decrease predicted by signaling theory. Ventures with precise positioning (Q1) succeed at 12.3%, those with vague positioning (Q4) succeed at 12.9%, while intermediate quartiles show varying rates (Q2 = 8.9%, Q3 = 16.0%). The highest success rate appears in Q3, not at either extreme—a pattern that initially appears inconsistent with both signaling theory and strategic ambiguity arguments.

## ¶4. The Movement Principle

Our most striking finding resolves this apparent anomaly: what matters is not where ventures start but whether they move. Companies that repositioned their strategic positioning (adaptive capacity A > 0) succeed at 18.1%, compared to 7.0% for those that stayed fixed—a 2.6× advantage. The Q3 anomaly dissolves once we account for movement: Q3 ventures have the highest movement rate (68%), explaining their aggregate success despite having the lowest success rate among stayers (6.6%). Direction of movement matters little: among movers, those who focused (D < 0) succeed at 17.6% while those who broadened (D > 0) succeed at 18.6%—a trivial difference compared to the 2.6× movement effect. We term this the Movement Principle: vagueness creates strategic options, but exercising those options—not merely holding them—drives success.

## ¶5. The Capital-Flexibility Tradeoff

We also examine whether early capital constrains the strategic adaptation that predicts success. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant but economically small capital-flexibility friction: the correlation between early funding (E) and adaptive capacity (A) is ρ(A,E) = −0.009 (p < 0.001). This effect, while directionally consistent with commitment theories that suggest capital creates constraints, explains less than 0.01% of variance in adaptation. The strong negative correlation between early capital and later success (ρ(L,E) = −0.211***) likely reflects multiple mechanisms—market selection, overfunding effects, expectation management—beyond flexibility alone. We present the capital-flexibility tradeoff as suggestive evidence rather than a deterministic "trap," acknowledging that our correlational design cannot distinguish commitment costs from selection effects.

## ¶6. The Central Question

This dissertation addresses a fundamental tension in entrepreneurial strategy: when does positioning flexibility enable adaptation, and what factors constrain or enable the exercise of strategic options? We operationalize positioning flexibility through vagueness (V), a measure of initial market positioning breadth. We measure adaptation through adaptive capacity (A = |ΔV|), the absolute change in positioning over time. We assess success through progression to Later Stage VC funding (L), a milestone requiring substantial validation of venture progress. Our analysis documents associations between these variables while acknowledging the limitations of observational data for causal inference.

## ¶7. Contributions

This dissertation offers three contributions to the entrepreneurship literature. First, we reject signaling theory's monotonic prediction that precision always helps. The positive Spearman correlation between vagueness and success (ρ = +0.024***) contradicts the assumption that vagueness degrades information value monotonically. Second, we establish the Movement Principle: adaptation matters more than initial positioning, with a 2.6× success advantage for movers over stayers. This finding reframes the vagueness debate from "what position is best" to "does the venture adapt." Third, we document a small but significant capital-flexibility friction (ρ = −0.009***), suggesting that early capital may be associated with reduced adaptation, though the economic magnitude is modest. Together, these findings suggest that strategic vagueness functions not as noise but as optionality—valuable when exercised through adaptation.

## ¶8. Dissertation Structure

This thesis presents two empirical papers and a discussion chapter. Paper U ("When Vagueness Pays") establishes the non-monotonic relationship between positioning vagueness and success, documenting the Movement Principle as the dominant predictor. Paper C ("The Capital-Flexibility Tradeoff") examines whether early capital constrains adaptation, finding a statistically significant but economically small friction effect. The Discussion synthesizes findings from both papers, articulates practical implications for entrepreneurs and investors, acknowledges limitations, and proposes directions for future research. Across all chapters, we prioritize empirical precision over theoretical scope, presenting what the data show rather than claiming what they cannot establish.
