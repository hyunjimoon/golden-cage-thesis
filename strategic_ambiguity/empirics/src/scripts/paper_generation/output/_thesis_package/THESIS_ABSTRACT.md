## Abstract

This dissertation challenges the dominant paradigm that clarity always wins in entrepreneurship. Analyzing **180,860 technology ventures** (2021-2025), I document three principles that fundamentally reshape our understanding of strategic positioning under uncertainty.

**The Movement Principle.** Companies that repositioned their strategic positioning (D ≠ 0) achieve 18.1% success versus only 7.0% for those that stayed fixed—a 2.6× advantage. Critically, direction matters less than movement itself: focusing (17.6%) and broadening (18.6%) produce similar outcomes among movers. Vagueness buys options; success requires using them.

**The Golden Cage Paradox.** Early capital systematically reduces strategic flexibility (ρ(A,E) = −0.009***), yet flexibility significantly predicts growth (ρ(G,A) = +0.044***). The combined effect is a Capital Curse: ρ(G,E) = −0.211***. Money buys commitment, not flexibility. In uncertain environments, flexibility—not resources—drives growth.

**The Channel Principle.** Both precise positioning (Q1: 12.3%) and vague positioning (Q4: 12.9%) outperform intermediate positioning (Q2: 8.9%)—a statistically significant U-shape (χ² = 841.3***). Analysts verify precise claims; Believers project onto vague visions. The murky middle fails both.

These findings integrate into a unified framework: **Strategic Ambiguity as Option Management**. I propose the Promise Vendor model where optimal portfolio size k* = F⁻¹(Cᵤ/(Cᵤ + Cₒ)) depends on the critical ratio between FOMO costs and burn costs. When FOMO dominates (deep-tech), hold more options; when burn dominates (software), focus.

**Contributions.** This work (1) establishes boundary conditions for signaling theory, (2) documents the Golden Cage mechanism linking capital to rigidity, and (3) provides practical guidance: choose your channel, preserve flexibility, and commit to movement.

## The Three Principles

1. **Movement Principle**: Vagueness buys options—USE THEM
2. **Golden Cage Principle**: Money buys commitment, not flexibility
3. **Channel Principle**: Choose Analyst or Believer, never the murky middle
