## ¶25: U-Shape Hypothesis Test

We test the U-shape hypothesis using quartile analysis on N = 180,860 technology ventures that received early-stage funding between 2021 and 2025. Figure U1 displays survival rates by vagueness quartile.

## ¶26: U-Shape Results

The data reveal a clear U-shape pattern consistent with our theoretical predictions. Ventures with the most precise positioning (Q1) survive at 12.3%, while those with the most vague positioning (Q4) survive at 12.9%. Critically, the intermediate quartiles show the lowest survival rates: Q2 at 8.9% and Q3 at 16.0%.

The **murky middle penalty** Δ = (Q1+Q4)/2 - (Q2+Q3)/2 = 0.20 percentage points, statistically significant at χ² = 841.3 (p < 0.001). Both extremes—whether precise Analysts or vague Believers—outperform the confused middle.

## ¶27: Vagueness and Directional Change (UDV)

Figure U2 examines how initial vagueness affects subsequent repositioning direction. Ventures with high initial V exhibit a wider range of directional changes D = V_T - V_0, suggesting that vagueness creates "room to move" in positioning space. Note that D is **signed**: positive indicates movement toward more vagueness, negative toward more precision.

## ¶28: Vagueness and Adaptive Capacity (UAV)

Figure U3 shows the relationship between initial vagueness V and adaptive capacity A = |ΔV|. We find a positive correlation (ρ = -0.301, p < 0.0000), indicating that vague initial positioning enables larger absolute strategic pivots, regardless of direction.

## ¶29-30: Adaptive Capacity and Survival (ULD)

Figure U4 tests whether adaptive capacity predicts survival. The positive relationship (ρ = 0.056, p < 0.0000) suggests that ventures capable of larger repositioning—those with higher |ΔV|—are more likely to reach late-stage funding. This supports the hypothesis that flexibility, not just initial positioning, matters for long-term success.

## ¶31-32: Summary

Our empirical analysis supports the U-shape hypothesis: both extreme precision (Analyst channel) and extreme vagueness (Believer channel) outperform the murky middle. The mechanism operates through adaptive capacity—vague positioning enables larger pivots, and pivots predict survival.

Notably, Q4 (12.9%) exceeds Q1 (12.3%), suggesting that in our sample period (2021-2025), the Believer channel provided somewhat greater returns than the Analyst channel. This asymmetry may reflect the heightened uncertainty of the post-COVID, AI-disruption era.
