## ¶57-58: The Causal Mechanism

We propose that early capital affects growth through its impact on adaptive capacity. The mechanism can be expressed as:

**dG/dE = (dG/d|ΔV|) × (d|ΔV|/dE) = (+) × (−) < 0**

Figure C1 illustrates each component of this causal chain.

## ¶59-60: The Golden Cage (Key Finding)

Figure C2 presents our central empirical finding. We observe a significant negative relationship between early capital and adaptive capacity (ρ = -0.009, p < 0.0001).

This **"Golden Cage"** effect suggests that well-funded ventures become locked into their initial positioning. Several mechanisms may explain this pattern:

1. **Stakeholder lock-in**: Early investors expect commitment to the funded strategy
2. **Resource curse**: Abundant resources reduce the perceived need to adapt
3. **Organizational inertia**: Larger teams and more complex operations resist change
4. **Sunk cost psychology**: High investment increases commitment to current path

## ¶61-62: Flexibility and Growth

Figure C3 confirms the second link in our causal chain. Adaptive capacity positively predicts growth (ρ = 0.044, p < 0.0000), indicating that flexibility enables value creation in uncertain environments.

## ¶63-64: The Capital Paradox

Combining these effects, we find a negative net relationship between early capital and growth (ρ = -0.211, p < 0.0000). Despite conventional wisdom that more funding enables growth, our data suggest the opposite.

The mechanism: **Money buys commitment, not flexibility.** And in uncertain environments, flexibility—not resources—drives growth.

This finding has important implications for entrepreneurial finance:
- Entrepreneurs should consider whether large early rounds may constrain future adaptation
- Investors should recognize that over-funding may reduce, not increase, expected returns
- The "lean startup" philosophy receives empirical support from our data

The Golden Cage is real: capital that appears to expand possibilities may actually narrow them.
