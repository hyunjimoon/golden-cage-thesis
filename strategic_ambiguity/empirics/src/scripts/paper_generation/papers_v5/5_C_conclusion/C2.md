# C2: Limitations & Extensions

**¶109-112 | Boundary Conditions**

---

**¶109** **Selection bias**: Successful zoom-in ventures "graduate" from early-stage datasets. They reach Later Stage VC and exit observation window. What remains observable are stayers who haven't escaped. This understates zoom-in survival premium—actual advantage may exceed 1.82×.

**¶110** **Generalizability**: Mobility finding (B₀=78, 91% stayer, 5% survival) may not extend to all high-capital industries. Replication in biotech, cleantech, deep tech needed. High-B₀ vs Low-B₀ trap distinction requires validation across contexts.

**¶111** **Investor behavior change**: If funding traps ventures, how should VC practices evolve? Industry selects for vision alignment; findings suggest selecting for belief diversity. Requires institutional change: restructured due diligence, new syndication patterns, different milestone structures.

**¶112** **Trap detection**: Can we identify traps before they form? Early warning indicators—belief variance collapse, escalation language in updates, metric obsession disconnected from learning—deserve systematic study. Real-time B measurement could enable intervention before traps lock in.
