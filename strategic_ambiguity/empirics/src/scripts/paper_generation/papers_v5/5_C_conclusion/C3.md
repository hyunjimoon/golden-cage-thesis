**¶113** **Contributions.** This dissertation makes three contributions:

*Layer 1 (What):* I introduce Absolute Repositioning A = |R| = |B_T − B₀| and establish two relationships:
- dG/dA > 0 (repositioners outperform 1.82×)
- dA/dF < 0 (capital suppresses repositioning)

*Layer 2 (How):* I decompose the Funding Paradox:
```
dG/dF = (dG/dA)(dA/dF) < 0
```
Two distinct trap mechanisms:
- High-B₀ trap (too vague to learn)
- Low-B₀ trap (too specific to pivot)

*Layer 3 (Why):* I derive the Learning Trap condition:
```
μ(1−μ) < ε × B
```
Showing how funding triggers belief variance collapse at both extremes.

**Escape routes**: Repositioners (zoom in or zoom out) outperform stayers regardless of direction—the common factor is movement itself.

**Boundary conditions**: Findings hold when B₀ > 30, F > $1M, and uncertainty exceeds coordination benefits.

**Prescription**: Commit to movement, not to the promises that fund it.
