# C1: Practitioner Implications

**¶105-108 | Target: Entrepreneurs, Investors**

---

## For Entrepreneurs

**¶105** **The world you live in**: You raised capital to accelerate learning, but the more you raise, the harder it becomes to change course. Investors who loved your vision now hold you accountable to it. Board meetings become performance theater. Internal doubts become unspeakable. You are not imagining this. The data confirms: dG/dF < 0 in early-stage ventures.

**¶106** **Prescription**: Separate internal compass from external pitch. Internally, track whether you are repositioning (|R| > 0) or stuck. Externally, frame strategy as provisional: "We believe X, and here is how we will test it." Repositioners outperform stayers 1.82× not because movement is always right, but because staying is almost always wrong.

## For Investors

**¶107** **Counterintuitive signal**: Conviction alignment with founder may be risk factor, not strength. When you share identical beliefs, belief variance collapses. The venture loses capacity to learn from disagreement. Survivors are those that could update. Seek co-investors who challenge your thesis. Their disagreement is insurance against the trap.

**¶108** **Fund repositioning capacity, not positions**: Structure terms that permit pivoting. Replace milestone rigidity with learning milestones: "What did you learn?" rather than "Did you hit target?" The 1.82× survival advantage for repositioners suggests best investment is in venture's capacity to revise, not the vision itself.
