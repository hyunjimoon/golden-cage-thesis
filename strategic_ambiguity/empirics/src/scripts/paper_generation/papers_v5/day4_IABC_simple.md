# The Commitment Trap

## I. Puzzle

Capital should accelerate growth. Yet in nascent markets:

$$\frac{dG}{dF} < 0$$

Why does funding suppress growth?

---

## A. Decomposition

$$\frac{dG}{dF} = \underbrace{\frac{dG}{dA}}_{+} \times \underbrace{\frac{dA}{dF}}_{-} < 0$$

| Link | Finding | Implication |
|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| **AG** | Movers outperform stayers 1.82× | Repositioning drives growth |
| **FA** | More funding → less repositioning | Capital anchors position |

The product is negative: funding enables growth but prevents the repositioning that growth requires.

## B. Mechanism: Golden Cage

**Theorem**: TRAP ⟺ HHI > θ

Three stages create the trap:

1. **Capital requires commitment** → specific promises to attract funding
2. **Commitment attracts believers** → stakeholder homogeneity rises (HHI↑)
3. **Homogeneity blocks learning** → no champion for alternatives

When everyone agrees, no one can learn.

## C. Prescription

**Sequence matters**: Q2 → Q3 → Q1

| Question | Action | Tool |
|:---------|:-------|:-----|
| Q2: How to build? | Validate operations first | Evaluate |
| Q3: Where to play? | Choose market after validation | Segment |
| Q1: How to scale? | Capitalize last, not first | Platformize |

**Error pattern**: Applying Q1 (Capitalize) before Q2 (Evaluate) and Q3 (Segment).

**Core principle**: *Nail with flexibility, Scale with commitment.*
