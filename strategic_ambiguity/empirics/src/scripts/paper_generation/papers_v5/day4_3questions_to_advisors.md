# Four Questions for Advisors

## Context

Today I identified what I believe is the **core contribution** of this thesis — a distinction from existing literature that I'd like you to validate.

I've prepared:
- **CORE_CONTRIBUTION** (2 pages): The key theoretical distinction
- **Executive Summary** (9 pages): Full thesis draft with Ghemawat/Gans backbone

I would appreciate your feedback on four questions, starting with the most important.

---

## Question 0: Core Contribution (Most Important)

### Prior Hypothesis

Existing literature (Bolton et al., 15.431) treats milestone investment as solving **moral hazard** — founders *won't* pivot because of misaligned incentives.

This thesis argues the real problem is **governance lock-in** — founders *can't* pivot even when they want to.

| Dimension | Moral Hazard View | This Thesis |
|:----------|:------------------|:------------|
| Problem | Founders **won't** | Founders **can't** |
| Cause | Incentive misalignment | Stakeholder homogeneity (HHI > θ) |
| Solution | Monitor founders | Design governance diversity |

### Question

**Is this distinction:**

- **(A) A genuine theoretical advance** — Different mechanism, different prescription
- **(B) A reframing of existing ideas** — Same insight, different language

### If (B), what would make it genuinely new?

**Scott's view:** _______________________________________________

**Charlie's view:** _______________________________________________

## Question 1: Integration Test

### Prior Hypothesis

I propose that Scott's "Test Two, Choose One" can be operationalized through Charlie's modular operations design:

| Scott (Strategy) | Charlie (Operations) |
|:-----------------|:--------------------|
| Keep two paths open | Shared platform (80%) + differentiated apps (20%) |
| Gather signals | Same KPIs measured for both paths |
| Choose based on evidence | Decision gate with operational criteria |
| Commit to winner | Redeploy shared infrastructure |

### Question

**Does this integration feel:**

- **(A) Organic** — The frameworks naturally connect; this is a valid extension of both
- **(B) Forced** — The connection is artificial; a different integration would be stronger

### If (B), what integration would be more natural?

**Scott's perspective:** _______________________________________________

**Charlie's perspective:** _______________________________________________

## Question 2: Empirical Balance

### Prior Hypothesis

I plan to use two types of evidence:

| Evidence Type | Example | Purpose |
|:--------------|:--------|:--------|
| **Deep case** | Motional (AV startup) | Mechanism illustration, NSS flagship |
| **Validation case** | Ford/GM $19B EV write-off | Scale demonstration, causal identification |

The Ford/GM case offers advantages:
- Public data (audited financials)
- Natural experiment (Biden → Trump policy shock)
- Large magnitude ($19B = commitment trap is real)

### Question

**What is the optimal balance?**

- **(A) Motional depth priority** — Focus on Motional as primary case; Ford/GM as supporting evidence
- **(B) Ford/GM validation priority** — Lead with Ford/GM for credibility; Motional for mechanism detail
- **(C) Equal weight** — Both cases receive comparable depth

### What would make this dissertation compelling for:

**Academic audience:** _______________________________________________

**Practitioner audience (NSS):** _______________________________________________

## Question 3: Structural Choice

### Prior Hypothesis

I have benchmarked the thesis structure against Johannes Galatsanos-Dueck's MIT Sloan thesis (Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery), which features:
- Framework development + benchmark analysis
- Industry interviews (qualitative)
- Decision guidance for practitioners
- ~60 pages, 8 chapters

### Question

**Is this benchmark appropriate?**

- **(A) Yes** — The structure fits a strategy/operations integration thesis
- **(B) No** — A different structure would be stronger: _______________

### For the thesis to "look, think, and act" like a PhD dissertation, what is the single most important element?

**Scott's view:** _______________________________________________

**Charlie's view:** _______________________________________________

## Summary of Requested Feedback

| Question | Focus | Decision Needed |
|:---------|:------|:----------------|
| **Q0** | **Contribution** | **Is "can't not won't" a genuine advance?** |
| Q1 | Integration | Is Scott × Charlie organic or forced? |
| Q2 | Evidence | Motional vs. Ford/GM balance |
| Q3 | Structure | Johannes benchmark appropriate? |

---

## Evaluation Metric (For Reference)

I am optimizing for:

```
Thesis Success = 0.35(Contribution) + 0.35(Mechanism) + 0.30(Operationalization)
```

| Dimension | Question | Primary Evaluator |
|:----------|:---------|:------------------|
| **Contribution** | What's NEW vs existing literature? | Scott |
| **Mechanism** | Is the causal chain precise? | Angie |
| **Operationalization** | Is it actionable Monday? | Charlie |

---

## Appendix: Two Versions Compared

| Dimension | Version A | Version B |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| **Starting point** | Existing draft | From scratch |
| **Structure** | Empirical puzzle → Theory → Application | Theory → Mechanism → Evidence |
| **Ghemawat/Gans** | Added as backbone | Built around backbone |
| **Emphasis** | Funding paradox (dG/dF < 0) | Three conditions for flexibility |
| **Recommendation** | Q2→Q3→Q1 sequence | Modular operations design |

**Which version better serves the thesis goals?**

*Thank you for your time. A 15-20 minute discussion would be valuable if your schedule permits.*
