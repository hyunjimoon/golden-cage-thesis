## Core Argument in One Page

### The Problem

Entrepreneurs face a fundamental tension:
- **Commitment creates capability** (Ghemawat, 1991; Fine, 2022)
- **Flexibility preserves optionality** (McGrath, 1999; Stern, 2021)

Existing literature treats these as competing paradigms. This thesis argues they are **sequential phases** of a unified strategy.

### The Framework

**Ghemawat's Insight:** Flexibility beats commitment when:
1. Irreversibility is high
2. Ambiguity is high
3. Learning is possible

**Gans et al.'s Prescription:** "Test Two, Choose One"
- Maintain two strategic paths
- Gather signals
- Commit based on evidence

**This Thesis:** Operationalizes "Test Two, Choose One" through modular operations design, enabling partial commitment in capital-intensive settings.

### The Application

**Mobility ventures** exemplify the tension:
- Capital intensity forces early commitment
- Technology uncertainty demands flexibility
- Result: 91% remain stuck (stayers), 5% survive

**Cases:**
- Ford/GM: $19B+ write-off from premature EV commitment
- Motional: Trapped in L4 without testing strategies
- Tesla: Escaped via broad promise + staged commitment

### The Contribution

| From | To |
|:-----|:---|
| Commitment vs. Flexibility (static choice) | Flexibility → Commitment (dynamic sequence) |
| "Test Two, Choose One" (strategy concept) | Modular operations design (implementation) |
| Theory (Ghemawat, Gans) | Application (mobility ventures) |

## Chapter 1: Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Ghemawat's Commitment Framework

Ghemawat (1991) established that strategy is fundamentally about commitment—choices that foreclose alternatives. But he also identified **when flexibility dominates**:

**Three Conditions for Flexibility:**

| Condition | Definition | Test |
|:----------|:-----------|:-----|
| **High Irreversibility** | Sunk costs cannot be recovered | Can investments be redeployed? |
| **High Ambiguity** | Outcomes genuinely uncertain | Do experts disagree on timing/approach? |
| **Learning Possible** | Information reveals over time | Will waiting 12-24 months clarify? |

**Four Lock-in Mechanisms:**

| Mechanism | How It Operates | Escape Difficulty |
|:----------|:----------------|:------------------|
| **Lock-in** | Sunk investments create expectations | High (capital gone) |
| **Lock-out** | Alternatives foreclosed | Very High (paths closed) |
| **Lags** | Commitments precede outcomes | Medium (time required) |
| **Inertia** | Organization resists change | Medium (culture shift) |

**Key insight:** Lock-in and lock-out are flip sides. Committing to Path A simultaneously forecloses Path B.

### 1.2 Gans et al.'s Entrepreneurial Strategy

Gans, Scott, and Stern (2021) identified two archetypal patterns:

**The Tesla Pattern (Success):**
```
Broad Promise → Extended Exploration → Staged Commitment → Dominance
"Sustainable energy"  Multiple products    Roadster→S→3→Y    Global leader
```

**The Better Place Pattern (Failure):**
```
Narrow Promise → Early Exploitation → Full Commitment → Liquidation
"Battery swap"    One approach        $850M invested    Bankrupt 2013
```

**The Prescription:** "Test Two, Choose One"
- Keep two paths open until signals clarify
- The cost of parallel investment < cost of wrong commitment

### 1.3 The Integration Gap

| Scholar | Framework | Gap |
|:--------|:----------|:----|
| Ghemawat | When to commit | Not how to maintain flexibility operationally |
| Gans et al. | Test Two, Choose One | Not how to implement in capital-intensive settings |
| Fine | 10 Tools | Not sequenced for flexibility-commitment tradeoff |

**This thesis fills the gap:** Operationalizing "Test Two, Choose One" through modular operations design.

## Chapter 2: The Commitment Trap Model

### 2.1 The Mechanism

```
Capital Raised
      ↓
Specific Promise Required ("L4 robotaxi by 2027")
      ↓
Investors Who Believe Join; Skeptics Exit
      ↓
Stakeholder Homogeneity ↑ (HHI > θ)
      ↓
No Champion for Alternatives
      ↓
Learning Blocked → TRAP
```

### 2.2 Formal Statement

**Definition:** A venture is in the Commitment Trap when HHI > θ and all three Ghemawat conditions hold.

**Implication:** The venture should be flexible but cannot be, due to governance lock-in.

### 2.3 The Paradox Quantified

| Variable | Definition | Relationship |
|:---------|:-----------|:-------------|
| F | Early-stage funding | — |
| G | Growth (total funding / early VC) | — |
| A | Absolute repositioning | — |

**Findings:**
- dG/dA > 0 (Movement drives growth: movers 1.82× vs stayers)
- dA/dF < 0 (Funding suppresses movement)
- dG/dF < 0 (The paradox: more funding, less growth)

## Chapter 3: Empirical Evidence

### 3.1 Ford/GM: The $19B Lesson

**Setup (2020-2022):**
- Full commitment to all-electric future
- Factory retooling, supplier contracts, public promises
- Ghemawat's three conditions: ALL PRESENT

| Condition | Ford/GM Status |
|:----------|:---------------|
| High Irreversibility | $B in EV-specific factories |
| High Ambiguity | Consumer adoption uncertain |
| Learning Possible | Hybrid alternative existed |

**Shock (2024-2025):** Biden → Trump policy shift

**Result:** Ford wrote off $19B+; GM similar losses

**Interpretation:** Premature full commitment under the three conditions destroyed value at massive scale.

### 3.2 Motional: The Startup Version

| Dimension | Motional | Risk |
|:----------|:---------|:-----|
| Promise | "L4 robotaxi" | Narrow (Better Place pattern) |
| Commitment | $4B invested | Full (no parallel paths) |
| Governance | Hyundai + Aptiv | Concentrated (HHI > θ) |
| Three conditions | All present | Should be flexible, but isn't |

**Validation:** Motional confirmed being "stuck in L4 without testing strategies."

### 3.3 Pattern Comparison

| Company | Promise | Commitment | Governance | Outcome |
|:--------|:--------|:-----------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Tesla** | Broad | Staged | Musk control | Leader |
| **Better Place** | Narrow | Full | VC concentrated | Liquidated |
| **Ford EV** | Narrow | Full | Board/public | $19B loss |
| **Motional** | Narrow | Full | JV partners | At risk |

## Chapter 4: The Partial Commitment Solution

### 4.1 Operationalizing "Test Two, Choose One"

**Scott's Strategy Logic:**
```
Two Paths → Gather Signals → Evidence-Based Choice
```

**Charlie's Operations Translation:**

| Strategy | Operations Implementation |
|:---------|:-------------------------|
| Two paths | Shared platform (80%) + differentiated apps (20%) |
| Gather signals | Same KPIs measured for both paths |
| Evidence-based choice | Decision gate with operational criteria |
| Commit to winner | Redeploy shared infrastructure |

### 4.2 Fine's 10 Tools Sequenced

**Phase 1: NAIL (High Flexibility)**

| Tool | Application | Commitment Level |
|:-----|:------------|:-----------------|
| Evaluate | Test both paths with same metrics | 20% |
| Segment | Identify which market responds | 20% |
| Collaborate | Partners for both paths | 20% |

**Phase 2: TRANSITION (Moderate Commitment)**

| Tool | Application | Commitment Level |
|:-----|:------------|:-----------------|
| Replicate | Scale winning path's operations | 50% |
| Automate | Standardize winning path | 50% |

**Phase 3: SCALE (High Commitment)**

| Tool | Application | Commitment Level |
|:-----|:------------|:-----------------|
| Processify | Lock in winning approach | 80% |
| Platformize | Build for scale | 80% |
| Capitalize | Raise for scale, not exploration | 80% |

### 4.3 The Q2 → Q3 → Q1 Sequence

```
Q2 (Explore)         Q3 (Focus)           Q1 (Scale)
     │                    │                    │
     ▼                    ▼                    ▼
"How to build?"     "Where to play?"     "How to scale?"
     │                    │                    │
     ▼                    ▼                    ▼
Test two paths      Choose one path      Commit fully
```

**Common Error:** Q1 → Q2 → Q3 (Capitalize before Evaluate)

**Correct Sequence:** Q2 → Q3 → Q1 (Validate before Capitalize)

## Chapter 5: Application to Motional

### 5.1 Current Position

Motional is in Q1 position with Q2 needs:
- High capital raised (Q1 characteristic)
- High uncertainty remaining (Q2 need)
- Mismatch creates trap

### 5.2 Recommended Path

**Step 1: Return to Q2 (Evaluate)**
- Test L2/L3 ADAS alongside L4
- Measure: $/mile, safety metrics, regulatory progress
- Duration: 12-18 months

**Step 2: Execute Q3 (Segment)**
- Choose: Robotaxi vs. Trucking vs. ADAS licensing
- Criteria: Unit economics, time-to-revenue, partner alignment
- Duration: 6 months

**Step 3: Re-enter Q1 (Scale)**
- Commit remaining capital to chosen path
- Deploy shared infrastructure
- Duration: Ongoing

### 5.3 Operational Design

| Component | Shared (80%) | Differentiated (20%) |
|:----------|:-------------|:--------------------|
| Sensor stack | Core perception | Application-specific tuning |
| Software platform | Base autonomy | Use-case modules |
| Safety validation | Core certification | Route-specific testing |
| Partnerships | Technology partners | Go-to-market partners |

## Chapter 6: Contribution and Limitations

### 6.1 Theoretical Contribution

| Integration | Result |
|:------------|:-------|
| Ghemawat + Gans | Conditions under which "Test Two" is essential |
| Gans + Fine | Operational implementation of "Test Two" |
| Ghemawat + Fine | Lock-in/lock-out via operations design |

### 6.2 Practical Contribution

**For Founders:**
- Diagnostic: Are the three conditions present?
- Prescription: Q2 → Q3 → Q1 sequence
- Implementation: Modular operations design

**For Investors:**
- Warning: HHI > θ creates trap regardless of capital

### 6.3 Limitations

| Limitation | Implication |
|:-----------|:------------|
| Mobility-specific | Generalization needs testing |
| θ estimated | Direct HHI measurement needed |
| Survivor bias | Successful exits undersampled |
