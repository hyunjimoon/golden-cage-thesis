## Abstract

Ventures that raise more early-stage funding show lower subsequent growth (ρ = −0.196, p < 0.001, N = 408,697). This dissertation explains why through decomposition: **dG/dF = (dG/dA) × (dA/dF) < 0**. Repositioning predicts growth (dG/dA > 0), but funding suppresses repositioning (dA/dF < 0). Capital intended to enable learning instead locks trajectories through stakeholder commitment. Two trap mechanisms emerge: High-B₀ ventures stay too vague to learn; Low-B₀ ventures stay too specific to pivot. The learning trap condition μ(1−μ) < ε×B formalizes when belief updating halts.

**Prescription**: Nail it with flexibility, then scale it with commitment.

# I. Introduction

Capital should accelerate growth. Yet ventures raising more early-stage funding show *lower* subsequent growth: ρ(G,F) = −0.196 (p < 0.001, N = 408,697). I call this the **Funding Paradox**.

Resolution comes through decomposition. Growth depends on repositioning. Funding suppresses repositioning. Therefore funding suppresses growth:

$$dG/dF = \underbrace{(dG/dA)}_{(+)} \times \underbrace{(dA/dF)}_{(-)} < 0$$

**Table 1: Five Core Variables**

| Variable | Definition | Measurement |
|:---------|:-----------|:------------|
| F | Funding | Log early-stage capital ($) |
| G | Growth | Total funding / early VC |
| B | Breadth | Positioning scope (0-100 percentile) |
| R | Repositioning | B_T − B₀ (signed change) |
| A | Absolute Repositioning | \|R\| (magnitude of change) |

**Figure 1: Movers Outperform Stayers**

![Survival rates by repositioning type: Stayers 9.9%, Zoom-in 17.5%, Zoom-out 18.4%](figures/fig_I_stayer_vs_mover.png)

*Repositioners survive at 1.82× the rate of stayers. Direction matters less than movement itself.*

**Table 2: LTE Framework (Cronin et al., 2025)**

| Layer | Question | This Dissertation |
|:------|:---------|:------------------|
| L1 (What) | What correlates? | dG/dF = −0.196*** |
| L2 (How) | What sequence? | F → Commitment → Lock-in → A↓ |
| L3 (Why) | What mechanism? | μ(1−μ) < ε×B learning trap |

The contribution is not causal identification (L1), but mechanism decomposition (L2+L3)—enabling intervention design.

# A. Repositioning

## A1. The Repositioning Principle (dG/dA > 0)

Van den Steen (2017) formalizes why commitment creates value: irreversibility coordinates downstream decisions. If commitment to position creates value, stayers should outperform movers.

They don't. Repositioners outperform stayers **1.82×** (18.0% vs 9.9% survival).

**Table 3: Survival by Repositioning Direction**

| Type | Condition | Survival Rate |
|:-----|:----------|:--------------|
| Zoom-in | R < 0 | 17.5% |
| Zoom-out | R > 0 | 18.4% |
| Stayer | R = 0 | 9.9% |

Van den Steen's mechanism remains valid. His scope condition does not. In nascent environments, the object of commitment must shift from *static position* to *repositioning capability*.

## A2. The Funding Anchor (dA/dF < 0)

Camuffo et al. show experimentation improves outcomes. Nanda shows staged capital enables experiments. If capital enables experimentation, funding should increase repositioning.

It doesn't. 1-SD increase in funding predicts **0.4 SD less repositioning** (p < 0.001).

**Two-Stage Mechanism**:

1. **Selection**: Commitment attracts capital. Precise visions attract investors who believe that exact thesis.
2. **Lock-in**: Capital reinforces commitment. Stakeholder expectations, board seats, milestone structures constrain pivoting.

Capital enables experimentation in principle. Commitment—required to obtain capital—impedes it in practice.

# B. Breadth

## B1. The Learning Trap

The Funding Anchor operates through belief variance collapse. Traps occur when:

$$\mu(1-\mu) < \varepsilon \times B$$

Where μ(1−μ) measures belief variance (capacity to update), and B measures breadth (inversely related to precision).

**Table 4: Two Trap Types**

| Trap | Mechanism | Example | Survival |
|:-----|:----------|:--------|:---------|
| High-B₀ | Too vague → can't falsify | Mobility (B₀=78) | 5% |
| Low-B₀ | Too specific → echo chamber | Motional ($4B) | 9.9% |

The Low-B₀ trap is insidious: precise promises attract believers. Believers filter out doubters. Unanimous agreement makes learning impossible.

## B2. Parallel Scaling (Sell × Deliver)

From the OIL framework, success requires both selling and delivering the promise:

$$P(Success | B) = P(Sell | B) \times P(Deliver | B)$$

Marketing (Segment) and Operations (Collaborate) must advance in **parallel**, not sequence.

**Table 5: Fine22 Tools Mapped to Q Framework**

| Question | Tools | Phase |
|:---------|:------|:------|
| Q2: How to build? | Collaborate, Automate, Evaluate | Nail |
| Q3: Where to play? | Segment, Replicate | Nail |
| Q1: How to scale? | Platformize, Capitalize | Scale |

**Figure 2: Motional's Strategic Trap**

*Motional error: Capitalize ($4B) before Evaluate (Q2) and Segment (Q3). Tool sequencing matters.*

# C. Conclusion

## C1. Practitioner Implications

**Figure 3: Escape Framework**

![From trap to movement: diagnostic framework for practitioners](figures/C_fig1_prescription.png)

*Entrepreneurs and investors can use this framework to diagnose trap type and prescribe escape routes.*

**For Entrepreneurs**:
- Track repositioning magnitude (\|R\| > 0), not just milestones
- Frame strategy as provisional: "We believe X; here's how we'll test it"
- Remember: repositioners survive at 1.82× the rate of stayers

**For Investors**:
- Conviction alignment may signal risk, not strength
- Seek co-investors who challenge your thesis
- Fund repositioning capacity, not fixed positions

## C2. Limitations

**Table 6: Limitations and Extensions**

| Limitation | Implication | Future Work |
|:-----------|:------------|:------------|
| Selection bias | Successful movers exit dataset; 1.82× understated | Survival analysis |
| Generalizability | Mobility-specific findings | Replication in biotech, cleantech |
| Trap detection | No early warning system | Real-time B measurement |

## C3. Contributions

**Layer 1**: Two empirical relationships established
- dG/dA > 0: Repositioners outperform stayers 1.82×
- dA/dF < 0: Capital suppresses repositioning

**Layer 2**: Funding Paradox decomposed
- dG/dF = (dG/dA)(dA/dF) < 0

**Layer 3**: Learning Trap mechanism derived
- μ(1−μ) < ε × B

**Prescription**: Commit to movement, not to the promises that fund it.
