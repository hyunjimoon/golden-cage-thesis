## AG.1: Strategy Gospel (Extending Van den Steen)

**¶12** Van den Steen (2017) formalizes why commitment creates strategic value: "Strategy is the smallest set of choices to optimally guide other choices." The more irreversible the choice, the more it coordinates downstream decisions.

**¶13** If commitment creates coordination value, repositioning destroys it. Movement signals either (a) initial position wrong, or (b) founder lacks conviction.

**¶14** Van den Steen's framework assumes the committed position is correct. In entrepreneurial contexts, uncertainty is high enough that the initial position is rarely optimal.

**¶15** I propose: Van den Steen's mechanism remains valid, but his scope condition does not hold in nascent ventures. In high-uncertainty environments, the object that merits commitment shifts from *static position* to *repositioning*.

**¶16** I define **Absolute Repositioning A = |R| = |B_T − B₀|**, the magnitude of change in breadth between two time points.

**¶17** Repositioning is not random pivoting. It is disciplined repositioning—Bayesian updating based on evidence. Distinction matters: random pivoting destroys coordination value, but disciplined repositioning preserves it by signaling *commitment to learning*.

## AG.2: Empirics (Testing dG/dA > 0)

**¶21** Van den Steen's framework predicts: if commitment to position creates coordination value, stayers should outperform movers. I test using 408,697 ventures from PitchBook (2021-2025).

**¶22** A = |R| = |B_T − B₀|. Growth G = reaching Later Stage VC.

**¶23** **Core finding: repositioners outperform stayers 1.82×.** Ventures with A > 0: 18.0% survival vs 9.9% for stayers.

**¶24** Regression: 1-SD increase in A predicts 7.3pp higher survival (p < 0.001).

**¶25** Direction matters:
| Type | Survival |
|:-----|:---------|
| Zoom-in (R < 0) | 17.5% |
| Zoom-out (R > 0) | 18.4% |
| Stayer (R = 0) | 9.9% |

**¶26** The finding challenges Van den Steen's scope, not his mechanism.

**¶29** **The Repositioning Principle (dG/dA > 0) is established.** Module AF investigates why funding suppresses repositioning.
