# BD: Direction Effects

**¶73-80 | "Why" — Zoom-in vs Zoom-out Analysis**

---

## Synthesis: Both Extremes Trap

**¶73** Both extremes trap ventures:
- **Too vague (high-B₀)**: hypotheses unfalsifiable, learning cannot identify what to reject
- **Too specific (low-B₀)**: commitment locks in direction, pivoting betrays believers

The stayer pattern (A ≈ 0) emerges from both mechanisms.

**¶74** Unified trap equation **μ(1−μ) < ε×B** captures both:
- High-B₀ traps fail on the right—no clear prediction to test
- Low-B₀ traps fail on the left—belief variance collapses to zero

**¶75** Funding accelerates both traps:
- High-B₀: attract "vision" investors who reward staying vague
- Low-B₀: attract "execution" investors who punish pivoting

Capital selects for the investors who will cage you.

**¶76** This completes the dA/dF < 0 mechanism. Funding **selects for stakeholders whose incentives resist movement**. Trap is structural, not intentional.

## Direction Patterns

**¶77** Data across industries:

| Industry | B₀ Level | Stayer Ratio | Survival |
|:---------|:---------|:-------------|:---------|
| Mobility | High (78) | 91% | 5% |
| Biotech (subset) | Low | High milestone | Low pivot success |

**¶78** Stayer archetype (A ≈ 0) has two origins:
- Some trapped at **high-B₀**—unable to zoom in
- Others trapped at **low-B₀**—unable to zoom out

Same outcome, different mechanisms.

## Direction-Based Escape Routes

**¶79** Escape requires different prescriptions:

| Trap Type | Direction Needed | Prescription |
|:----------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| **High-B₀** | Zoom In (R < 0) | Force specificity—testable hypotheses that can fail |
| **Low-B₀** | Zoom Out (R > 0) | Force diversity—doubters who preserve belief variance |

**¶80** The funding paradox is now explained:

```
dG/dF < 0 because (dG/dA > 0) × (dA/dF < 0)
```

Repositioning predicts growth; funding suppresses repositioning through **twin traps of flexibility and commitment**.

## Direction Variable R

R = B_T − B₀ determines escape strategy:

| R | Meaning | Example |
|:--|:--------|:--------|
| R < 0 | Zooming In | "Autonomy platform" → "L4 robotaxi in SF" |
| R > 0 | Zooming Out | "Robotaxi only" → "Full-stack AV provider" |
| R = 0 | Staying | Trapped (stayer) |

### Survival by Direction

| Direction | Survival |
|:----------|:---------|
| Zoom-in (R < 0) | 17.5% |
| Zoom-out (R > 0) | 18.4% |
| Stay (R = 0) | 9.9% |

## Connection to NFSC Framework

**¶81** Direction effects connect to "Nail with Flexibility, Scale with Commitment":

| Phase | B₀ Risk | Prescription |
|:------|:--------|:-------------|
| **Nail** | High-B₀ → stay vague | Force zoom-in before Scale |
| **Nail** | Low-B₀ → premature lock-in | Delay Scale until tested |
| **Scale** | — | Commit only after Nail validated |

The NFSC framework operationalizes the escape routes identified here.
