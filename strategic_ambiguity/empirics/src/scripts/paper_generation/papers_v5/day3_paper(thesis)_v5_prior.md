## Overview: v4 → v5 Evolution

| Version | Status | Key Changes |
|:--------|:-------|:------------|
| v4_init | Base | Original 7-module structure |
| v4_final | Completed Dec 29 | Terminology shift (V→B, M→R/A), Day 1 feedback |
| **v5_prior** | Current | Day 2 (E focus), Motional Meeting #4 integration |
| v5_posterior | Target Jan 3 | Week synthesis |

## Chapter Structure (7 Modules)

### Chapter 1: Introduction (I)
**Status**: v5_prior (Day 1 feedback incorporated)

| Variable | Definition (v5) |
|:---------|:----------------|
| **F** | Funding (early-stage capital, log $) |
| **G** | Growth (total funding / early VC) |
| **B** | Breadth (positioning scope, 0-100) |
| **R** | Repositioning = B_T − B₀ (signed) |
| **A** | Adaptation = \|R\| (absolute repositioning magnitude) |

**Core Equation**: `dG/dF = (dG/dA) × (dA/dF) < 0`

**Key Insight** (Charlie Day 1): "Nail it with flexibility, then scale it with commitment"

### Chapter 2: Paper A — Adaptation

#### AG: Adaptation Principle (dG/dA > 0)
- Repositioners outperform stayers 1.82× (18.0% vs 9.9% survival)
- Direction matters less than magnitude
- Van den Steen extension: object of commitment shifts from position to process
- **Real Options benchmark**: Delay commitment until uncertainty drops

#### AF: Funding Anchor (dA/dF < 0)
- Capital suppresses repositioning through stakeholder lock-in
- Two-stage mechanism: Selection → Lock-in
- Camuffo-Nanda extension: capital enables experimentation in principle, constrains in practice
- **Real Options violation**: Funding forces premature commitment → Lock-in/Lock-out

### Chapter 3: Paper B — Breadth/Traps

#### VM: Learning Trap Condition
**Equation**: μ(1−μ) < ε × B

| Trap Type | Mechanism | Example |
|:----------|:----------|:--------|
| **High-B₀** | Too vague → can't falsify hypotheses | Mobility (B₀=78, 5% survival) |
| **Low-B₀** | Too specific → can't pivot | Motional (echo chamber) |

#### VD: Direction Effects
- Zoom-in (R < 0): 17.5% survival
- Zoom-out (R > 0): 18.4% survival
- Stay (R = 0): 9.9% survival

### Chapter 4: Paper E — Escape (PAE Framework)
**Status**: v5_prior FOCUS (Day 2)

| Stage | Function | Motional Application |
|:------|:---------|:---------------------|
| **Platformize** | Expand stakeholder diversity | E2E Dashboard |
| **Acculturate** | Common language for uncertainty | "Anti-Gravity Model" vocabulary |
| **Evaluate** | Pre-committed repositioning protocols | Bayesian decision triggers |

**Motional Case** (Low-B₀, High-F, Low-A):
- $4B JV capital → stakeholder lock-in
- 4th meeting today: proposal → project scoping
- Prescription: Zoom-out (R > 0) via PAE

### Chapter 5: Conclusion (C)

#### C1: Practitioner Implications
- **Entrepreneurs**: Commit to repositioning capacity, not positions
- **Investors**: Seek belief diversity, not alignment

#### C2: Limitations & Extensions
- Selection bias (successful movers exit dataset)
- Generalizability (mobility-specific, needs replication)

#### C3: Coda
"Commit to movement, not to the promises that fund it."

## Two-Track Update System

| Track | Folder | Audience | Content |
|:------|:-------|:---------|:--------|
| **Advisor-facing** | `w9_acculturate(thesis)/` | Charlie, Scott | Minimal, sequential reveal |
| **Personal** | `papers_v5/` | Angie | Full simulation, all modules |

**Rationale**:
- Advisor track: Prevent cognitive overload, reveal one day at a time
- Personal track: Foreshadowing (simulate Day 1 feedback → all 7 modules)

## Dashboard Evolution

| Dashboard | Complexity | Purpose |
|:----------|:-----------|:--------|
| v4.0.0 | Full | Internal working version |
| v5_prior_minimal | Minimal | Advisor-facing (today) |
| v5_posterior | Medium | Post-week synthesis |

## Day 2 Deliverables

1. **EMAIL_BODY.md** ✓ — Short update + Motional #4 context
2. **E.md** ✓ — Paper E draft (PAE Framework)
3. **QUESTIONS_FOR_ADVISORS2.md** ✓ — 3 strategic questions
4. **PROTOCOL.md** ✓ — Updated with Day 1 decisions
