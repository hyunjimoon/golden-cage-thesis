**Subject:** Day 4 Update: Found the Core Contribution

---

Dear Scott and Charlie,

## The Breakthrough

Today I found what makes this thesis **new**, not just applied:

> **Existing literature**: Founders fail to pivot because they *won't* (moral hazard)
> **This thesis**: Founders fail to pivot because they *can't* (governance lock-in)

This is not a reframing. It's a different mechanism with different prescriptions:
- Moral hazard → Monitor founders
- Governance lock-in → **Design stakeholder diversity**

## The Mechanism

```
Governance Structure → Cognitive Structure → Signal Entropy → Learning Blocked
(Who is at table)     (What they believe)   (No diversity)   (Can't update)
```

**Precise claim**: Stakeholder homogeneity (HHI > θ) induces belief alignment, eliminating the signal diversity needed for Bayesian updating.

## Updated Evaluation Metric

```
Thesis Success = 0.35(Contribution) + 0.35(Mechanism) + 0.30(Operationalization)
```

| Dimension | Question | Status |
|:----------|:---------|:-------|
| **Contribution** | Different from moral hazard? | Yes: "Can't" ≠ "Won't" |
| **Mechanism** | Causal chain precise? | Yes: Gov → Cog → Signal |
| **Operationalization** | Monday actionable? | Working on Motional specifics |

## Four Questions (30 seconds each)

| Q | Question | A or B? |
|:-:|:---------|:--------|
| 0 | Is "can't not won't" **(A) a genuine advance** or **(B) reframing**? | |
| 1 | Scott × Charlie integration **(A) organic** or **(B) forced**? | |
| 2 | Primary case: **(A) Motional depth** or **(B) Ford/GM validation**? | |
| 3 | Johannes thesis structure **(A) appropriate** or **(B) not**? | |
