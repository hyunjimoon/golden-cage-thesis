**Re**: Updated evaluation framework for dissertation "The Commitment Trap"

## Evolution: Why We Changed the Metric

### Old Metric (Day 1-3)
```
U = 0.30(Quality) + 0.35(Applicability) + 0.35(Resonance)
```

**Problem discovered on Day 4**:
- "Quality" measured format, not substance
- "Resonance" was vague ("does advisor like it?")
- Led to: Polish first, discover later → 40% wasted effort

### New Metric (Day 4+)
```
U = 0.35(Contribution) + 0.35(Mechanism) + 0.30(Operationalization)
```

**Key insight**: "NEW first, Pretty later"

## The Three Dimensions

### 火 Contribution (35%) — "What's NEW?"

**Question**: Does this say something existing literature doesn't?

| Test | Pass | Fail |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Distinguishes from Bolton et al. moral hazard? | "Can't, not Won't" | Same as moral hazard |
| Extends Scott's "Test Two, Choose One"? | Adds governance constraint | Just applies it |
| Extends Charlie's 10 Tools? | Adds sequencing logic | Just lists them |

**Primary Evaluator**: Scott
**五行**: 火 (Fire) — ignition, creation

---

### 水 Mechanism (35%) — "WHY does it work?"

**Question**: Is the causal chain precise and falsifiable?

| Test | Pass | Fail |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Causal chain explicit? | Governance → Cognitive → Signal → Learning | Hand-waving |
| HHI > θ threshold defined? | Measurable condition | Vague "too much" |
| Counterfactual clear? | "If HHI < θ, learning would occur" | No prediction |

**Primary Evaluator**: Angie
**五行**: 水 (Water) — depth, understanding, flow

**The Causal Chain**:
```
Governance Structure    →    Cognitive Structure    →    Signal Entropy
(Who is at table)            (What they believe)         (Information diversity)
        ↓                           ↓                           ↓
HHI > θ (homogeneous)    →    Aligned beliefs      →    No diverse signals
        ↓                           ↓                           ↓
                         LEARNING BLOCKED
```

---

### 木 Operationalization (30%) — "HOW to use it Monday?"

**Question**: Can Motional act on this next week?

| Test | Pass | Fail |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Diagnostic tool? | "Check your HHI" | Abstract advice |
| Prescription steps? | "Q2 → Q3 → Q1 sequence" | "Be more flexible" |
| Measurable outcome? | "$/mile, incidents/1M miles" | Vague "improvement" |

**Primary Evaluator**: Charlie
**五行**: 木 (Wood) — growth, practical action

## 五行 Integration: The Generation Cycle

```
        土 State (Yellow)
       Current Understanding
              ↓
        火 NEW? (Red)
       What's the contribution?
              ↓
        水 WHY? (Blue)
       What's the mechanism?
              ↓
        木 HOW? (Green)
       How to operationalize?
              ↓
        金 Value (Gold)
       Refined thesis output
              ↓
        → Back to 土
```

**相生 (Generation)**: 土 → 金 → 水 → 木 → 火 → 土

**Key**: Follow the generation cycle, not the conflict cycle (相剋)

## Proof: Trajectory Comparison

### Actual Path (Day 4 morning, no protocol)
```
s₁ → s₂ → s₃ → s₄ → s₅ → s₆ → s₇ → s₈
[Polish][Polish][Polish][Polish][Challenge!][Discover][Refine]
```
- 8 transitions, ~5 hours
- 40% waste (s₁-s₅ = polishing before knowing what to say)
- Turning point late (s₆: "이게 최선인가?")

### Counterfactual Path (with protocol)
```
s'₁ → s'₂ → s'₃ → s'₄
[NEW?] → [WHY?] → [HOW?] → [DONE]
```
- 4 transitions, ~2 hours
- 10% waste
- Direction set early (s'₁)

### Metrics

| Dimension | Definition | Actual | Counterfactual |
|:----------|:-----------|:------:|:--------------:|
| **Effectiveness** | Did we reach core insight? | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (same) |
| **Efficiency** | Cost to get there | 5h, 40% waste | 2h, 10% waste |

**Conclusion**: Same effectiveness, 2-4× better efficiency with protocol

## Mapping to Advisors

| Advisor | Primary Dimension | Key Question | 五行 |
|:--------|:------------------|:-------------|:----:|
| **Scott** | Contribution | "Is this a theoretical advance?" | 火 |
| **Charlie** | Operationalization | "Can Motional use this Monday?" | 木 |
| **Angie** | Mechanism | "Is the causal logic precise?" | 水 |
| **All** | Integration | "Does 火→水→木 feel organic?" | 金 |

---

## Self-Assessment: Current State

| Dimension | Score | Evidence | Gap |
|:----------|:-----:|:---------|:----|
| **Contribution** | 0.7 | "Can't not Won't" distinction clear | Needs sharper contrast with Bolton |
| **Mechanism** | 0.8 | Gov → Cog → Signal chain explicit | Need empirical HHI measurement |
| **Operationalization** | 0.5 | Q2→Q3→Q1 proposed | Needs Motional-specific steps |

**Overall**: ~0.65 → Target: 0.85+

## Request for Feedback

### For Scott (火 Contribution):
1. Is "governance lock-in ≠ moral hazard" a sufficient theoretical advance?
2. Does this extend "Test Two, Choose One" or just apply it?

### For Charlie (木 Operationalization):
1. Is the Q2→Q3→Q1 sequence actionable for Motional?
2. Which of the 10 Tools should be prioritized?

### For Both (金 Integration):
1. Does the 火→水→木 sequence feel organic or forced?
2. Is the weight distribution (0.35/0.35/0.30) appropriate?

## One-Sentence Summary

> **Good thesis = NEW contribution (火) + Precise mechanism (水) + Monday actionable (木) → Refined value (金)**
