# Questions for Scott Stern (4 Questions, A/B Format)

**Context**: This thesis argues that funding suppresses repositioning (dA/dF < 0), and repositioning predicts growth (dG/dA > 0). The Funding Paradox: dG/dF = (dG/dA) × (dA/dF) < 0.

**Key Evidence**: Motional ($4B Hyundai-Aptiv JV, 2020) committed to L4 robotaxi. Applied Capitalize before Evaluate—scaled without nailing. CSO Sean Park confirmed: "stuck in L4 without testing different strategies." This Low-B₀ trap (precise commitment → echo chamber → blocked adaptation) is the thesis's focal mechanism.

## Question 1: Van den Steen Extension vs Scope Condition

**Background**: Van den Steen (2017) argues commitment creates coordination value through irreversibility. My finding: repositioners outperform stayers 1.82× (18.0% vs 9.9% survival).

**My Current Framing**: "Commitment remains the essence of strategy; the *object* shifts. Van den Steen's mechanism remains valid. In nascent environments, commitment should target repositioning capability rather than static position."

**Question**: Is this the right way to *extend* Van den Steen?

| Option A | Option B |
|:---------|:---------|
| **"Scope Extension"**: Keep current framing. Van den Steen is right about commitment value; I extend by specifying WHEN commitment should target position vs process. This is a boundary condition, not a contradiction. The LTE framework (Layer 2) shows HOW the mechanism operates differently in nascent vs mature markets. | **"Object Redefinition"**: Reframe more boldly. Van den Steen's "commitment" is to static strategy. I argue for commitment to dynamic repositioning. This isn't just scope—it's redefining what the "object" of commitment should be. The prescription "commit to movement, not to promises" captures this shift. |

**Your choice**: A / B / Neither (please explain)

## Question 2: Learning Trap Mechanism (Bayesian Formalization)

**Background**: I formalize the learning trap as:

```
μ(1−μ) < ε × B
```

Where:
- μ(1−μ) = belief variance (capacity to update)
- ε = learning threshold
- B = breadth (inversely related to precision)

**Two Trap Types**:
- High-B₀ trap: Too vague → can't falsify (Mobility sector, 5% survival)
- Low-B₀ trap: Too specific → echo chamber (Motional, $4B stayer)

**Question**: Is this Bayesian formalization the right level of abstraction for an entrepreneurship thesis?

| Option A | Option B |
|:---------|:---------|
| **"Keep Mathematical"**: The equation μ(1−μ) < ε×B provides precise conditions for trap entry. This connects to Bayesian entrepreneurship literature (Camuffo, Zellweger). The math forces clarity about what "too vague" and "too specific" mean. Keep it—it's the Layer 3 (Why) contribution. | **"Simplify to Intuition"**: The math may obscure more than illuminate. The core insight is simpler: "Extreme confidence (high or low) blocks learning." Replace the equation with prose that captures the same idea. Equations belong in appendix if anywhere. Accessibility matters more than precision for practitioner audience. |

**Your choice**: A / B / Neither (please explain)

## Question 3: Empirical Strategy—Correlation vs Mechanism

**Background**: My key statistics:
- ρ(G,F) = -0.196*** (Funding Paradox)
- N = 408,697
- Repositioner survival 1.82× stayer survival

I explicitly state: "The contribution is not causal identification (L1), but mechanism decomposition (L2+L3)—enabling intervention design."

**Question**: Is this positioning sufficient defense against "but it's just correlation" critique?

| Option A | Option B |
|:---------|:---------|
| **"Decomposition Defense"**: The LTE framework legitimizes non-causal contributions. Showing dG/dF = (dG/dA)(dA/dF) decomposes the paradox even without causal identification. Layer 2 (How) and Layer 3 (Why) are valuable research contributions. Keep current framing—it's honest about what the data can and cannot show. | **"Strengthen Causal Language"**: Add instrumental variable or regression discontinuity analysis as robustness check. Even if not perfectly identified, showing the relationship holds under different specifications strengthens the claim. The current framing may invite dismissal. Empirical work needs empirical defense. |

**Your choice**: A / B / Neither (please explain)

## Question 4: Syntax Master Paper (Structure Template)

**Background - My Scaling Strategy**:

I plan to accelerate thesis writing by separating **syntax** (logical structure) from **semantics** (my content):

| Layer | Definition | Source |
|:------|:-----------|:-------|
| **Syntax** | Argument flow, paragraph transitions, how claims build | Benchmark paper |
| **Semantics** | Variables (F, G, B, R, A), findings, Motional case | My research |

**How it works**:
1. Find a well-structured paper (the "syntax master")
2. Map its logical skeleton: "¶1 establishes puzzle → ¶2 presents surprising data → ¶3 proposes mechanism..."
3. Fill in my semantics while preserving the proven argument architecture
4. Result: Battle-tested structure + original contribution

**Current candidates I'm considering**:
- Van den Steen (2017) - "Strategy and the Strategist" (theoretical)
- Camuffo et al. (2020) - "A Scientific Approach..." (empirical + practitioner)
- Gans, Stern, Wu (2019) - "Foundations of Entrepreneurial Strategy" (framework)
- A Bayesian entrepreneurship paper from your recent work?

**What I need**: A paper with clear "puzzle → data → mechanism → prescription" flow that matches my thesis structure.

**Question**: Which paper would make the best "syntax master" for my thesis?

| Option A | Option B |
|:---------|:---------|
| **Gans, Stern, Wu (2019)**: Your co-authored framework paper. Strong "entrepreneurial strategy" framing that I'm building on. The four strategic choices structure could template how I present the funding paradox as a fifth consideration. | **Recommend another paper**: From your reading across strategy, entrepreneurship, and Bayesian learning literatures—which paper has the argument structure that best fits "paradox → decomposition → trap → prescription"? |

**Your recommendation**: A / B (please suggest specific paper)
