# Gemini Prompt: Syntax Master Mapping for Thesis v4

## Context

I'm writing a PhD dissertation on "The Funding Paradox" with this core finding:

```
dG/dF = (dG/dM)(dM/dF) < 0
```

**Translation**: Growth (G) is negatively correlated with Funding (F) because:
- Movement (M) predicts Growth: dG/dM > 0
- Funding suppresses Movement: dM/dF < 0

The mechanism is **two-stage**:
1. **Selection**: Commitment → Capital (founders commit precisely to attract funding)
2. **Lock-in**: Capital → Reinforcement (funding creates stakeholders who resist movement)

## Task

I'm assigning you as "Syntax Master" for each paper. Your job is to analyze each paper's:
1. **Academic writing conventions** (sentence structure, transition patterns, evidence presentation)
2. **Argument flow** (how claims connect to evidence)
3. **Vocabulary choices** (field-specific terminology)
4. **Citation patterns** (how prior work is invoked)

Then map these conventions to my thesis modules.

## The 4 Syntax Master Papers

| Paper | Module | Core Claim | Target Scholars |
|:------|:-------|:-----------|:----------------|
| **M_Empirics_zgk25.pdf** | MG, MF | Movement matters | Camuffo, Nanda |
| **T_Theory_GKSS21.pdf** | VM, VD | Learning trap condition | Stern, GKSS |
| **E_Solution_Motional.pdf** | E | Platformize → Acculturate → Evaluate | Motional case |
| **Arch_Structure_Cronin25.pdf** | Overall | Thesis architecture | Cronin structure |

## My Thesis v4 Module Structure

```
I ─ Introduction (dG/dF < 0 puzzle)
│
├─ MG: Movement Principle (dG/dM > 0)
│   - Gospel: Van den Steen "commit to position"
│   - Extension: "commit to MOVEMENT"
│   - Evidence: 18.0% vs 9.9% survival
│
├─ MF: Golden Cage (dM/dF < 0)
│   - Gospel: Camuffo/Nanda "capital enables experimentation"
│   - Puzzle: Why dM/dF < 0?
│   - Two-stage: Selection → Lock-in
│
├─ VM: Vagueness → Movement (dM/dV)
│   - High-V trap: unfalsifiable, flexibility paradox
│   - Low-V trap: commitment lock, echo chamber
│   - Formula: μ(1−μ) < ε/V
│
├─ VD: Vagueness → Direction (dD/dV)
│   - D = sign(ΔV): zoom-in vs zoom-out
│   - Escape routes: High-V needs D<0, Low-V needs D>0
│
├─ E: Escape (Motional Case Study)
│   - Diagnosis: Low-V, High-F, Low-M, D=0
│   - Prescription: Platformize → Acculturate → Evaluate
│
└─ C: Conclusion (Commit to Movement)
```

## What I Need From You

### 1. For Each Paper, Extract:

**A. Sentence Patterns**
- How do they open paragraphs?
- How do they transition between claims?
- What's the typical evidence sentence structure?

**B. Vocabulary Map**
- Key terms and their definitions
- How they introduce jargon
- Synonyms they use for repetition avoidance

**C. Citation Patterns**
- How do they invoke prior work? (parenthetical vs. narrative)
- How do they extend vs. challenge prior work?
- "X (YEAR) argues..." vs "Following X..."

**D. Argument Flow**
- Gospel → Puzzle → Resolution pattern?
- Theory → Evidence → Mechanism?
- Claim → Evidence → Qualification?

### 2. Module Mapping

For each thesis module, recommend:
- **Primary syntax master**: which paper's style to emulate
- **Key sentences to imitate**: specific sentence templates
- **Vocabulary to adopt**: field-specific terms
- **Citation style**: how to invoke the target scholars

## Example Output Format

```
## MG: Movement Principle

### Primary Syntax Master: M_Empirics_zgk25.pdf

### Sentence Templates:
1. Gospel claim: "The prevailing view in [FIELD] holds that [CLAIM] (SCHOLAR, YEAR)."
2. Puzzle: "Yet [EVIDENCE] suggests a more nuanced picture."
3. Evidence: "Figure N shows that [FINDING], with [STATISTIC]."

### Vocabulary Mapping:
- "Strategic positioning" → "strategic vagueness"
- "Pivot" → "movement"
- "Commitment" → "identity contract"

### Citation Style:
- Use narrative for Van den Steen: "Van den Steen (2017) argues that..."
- Use parenthetical for supporting: "(Ghemawat, 1991; Porter, 1996)"

### Key Transitions:
- "This finding extends X by..."
- "While X focused on [A], I examine [B]..."
```

## Deliverables

Please provide:
1. **Paper-by-paper analysis** (syntax patterns, vocabulary, citation style)
2. **Module-by-module mapping** (which paper style for which module)
3. **Top 10 sentence templates** I should use throughout
4. **Vocabulary glossary** mapping my terms to established literature

Thank you!
