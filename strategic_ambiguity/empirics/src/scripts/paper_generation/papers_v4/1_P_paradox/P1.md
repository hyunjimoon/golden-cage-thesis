# P1: The Funding Paradox

**¶1-11 | Keystone | Locks: E, M, G, core equation**

**¶01** Strategy theory and investment practice share an implicit assumption: capital enables commitment, commitment enables coordination, coordination enables growth. Van den Steen (2017) formalizes this logic—strategy creates value precisely because commitment is costly. Ghemawat (1991) concurs: irreversibility is not a bug but a feature. The more money you raise, the more credibly you commit, the better you should perform.

**¶02** I find the opposite. Ventures that raise more funding show *lower* growth rates. The correlation is robustly negative: ρ(G,E) = -0.196 (p < 0.001, N = 180,994). This is the Funding Paradox.

**¶03** This paper explains why. The answer lies in movement—the magnitude of strategic repositioning a venture undertakes. Movement predicts growth (dG/dM > 0), but funding suppresses movement (dM/dE < 0).

**¶04** The decomposition: dG/dE = (dG/dM) × (dM/dE). A positive times a negative yields the paradox.

**¶05** I define three variables. E = external funding raised. M = movement, measured as |ΔV| where V is strategic vagueness. G = growth, operationalized as reaching Later Stage VC (Series C/D+).

**¶06** Movement is not pivoting randomly. It is disciplined repositioning—what I call **Parallel Experimentation → Strategic Convergence**: ventures initiate multiple concurrent paths, then systematically narrow based on evidence, concentrating commitment on the highest-potential trajectory.

**¶07** The null hypothesis comes from strategy theory. As Porter (1996) argues, "strategic positions should have a horizon of a decade or more, not of a single planning cycle." Van den Steen (2017) formalizes why: strategy is "the smallest set of choices to optimally guide other choices"—its value derives from commitment's irreversibility. Ghemawat (1991) concurs that "commitment, far from being a source of inflexibility, is the very essence of strategy." All suggest stability should help, not hurt.

**¶08** My finding challenges this implicit assumption. In entrepreneurial contexts, movers outperform stayers 1.8×. The commitment that matters is commitment to movement capacity, not to fixed positions.

**¶09** Three patterns emerge: stayers (M≈0, 9.9% survival), zoom-in (M>0, ΔV<0, 17.5%), zoom-out (M>0, ΔV>0, 18.4%).

**¶10** Traps occur at both extremes. High-V ventures can't zoom in (mobility: V₀=78, 91% stayer, 5% survival). Low-V ventures can't zoom out. Funding reinforces both traps.

**¶11** The prescription: commit to movement, not to the promises that fund it.
