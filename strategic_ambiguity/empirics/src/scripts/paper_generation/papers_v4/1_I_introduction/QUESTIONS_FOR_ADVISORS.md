# The Funding Paradox: 3 Strategic Questions

Dear Professor,

Thank you for your time. I have three specific questions where your judgment would be invaluable.

## Q1. What should I call the "breadth of strategic positioning" variable?

**Context:** I measure how broadly vs. narrowly a venture defines its market.
- Example: "mobility solutions" (broad, V=80) vs. "e-scooter sharing in Boston" (narrow, V=20)

**My concern:** The term choice signals which literature I'm speaking to.

| Option | Pro | Con |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vagueness** | Matches my measurement method | Negative connotation—implies sloppiness |
| **Ambiguity** | Links to strategic ambiguity literature | May confuse with "uncertainty" |
| **Breadth** | Neutral, descriptive | Less theoretically loaded |

**Your recommendation?** _______________

**Why this choice?** _______________

## Q2. What should I call "magnitude of strategic repositioning"?

**Context:** I measure |V_T − V_0|, the absolute change in positioning breadth over time.
- Zoom-in: broad → narrow (e.g., "AI" → "AI for radiology")
- Zoom-out: narrow → broad (e.g., "drone delivery" → "logistics automation")

**My concern:** "Pivot" is practitioner-friendly but implies failure/abandonment. I need a term that covers both directions neutrally.

| Option | Pro | Con |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Movement** | Covers both directions; my proposal | Not established in literature |
| **Pivot** | Widely recognized | Implies discarding prior strategy |
| **Repositioning** | Academic standard | Generic; doesn't capture magnitude |

## Q3. How should I position my contribution relative to Van den Steen (2017)?

**Van den Steen's claim:** Strategy creates value because commitment is costly. Irreversibility signals credibility.

**My finding:** In nascent environments, commitment to a *position* predicts lower growth. Commitment to *movement capacity* predicts higher growth.

**My concern:** Should I frame this as extending his theory or challenging it?

| Option | Framing | Risk |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Extension** | "His theory holds, but requires a scope condition for high-uncertainty environments" | May undersell novelty |
| **Challenge** | "His mechanism reverses in nascent stages" | May invite unnecessary pushback |
| **Boundary condition** | "His theory applies to established firms; startups operate differently" | May seem like avoiding engagement |

**Your recommendation?** _______________

**Why this choice?** _______________

## Summary of My Current Choices

| Variable | Current term in I1 | Confidence |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| V | Vagueness | Medium |
| M | Movement | High |
| Van den Steen | Extension (scope condition) | Low |
