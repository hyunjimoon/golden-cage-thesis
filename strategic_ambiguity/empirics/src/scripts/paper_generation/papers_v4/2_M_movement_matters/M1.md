# M1: Strategy Gospel (Extending Van den Steen)

**¶12-20 | Target: Porter, Van den Steen | 9¶**

---

**¶12** Van den Steen (2017) formalizes why commitment creates strategic value: "Strategy is the smallest set of choices to optimally guide other choices." The more irreversible the choice, the more it coordinates downstream decisions. Ghemawat (1991) adds that commitment's value stems from its costliness—if reversal were cheap, competitors would simply wait and copy.

**¶13** This logic has profound implications. If commitment creates coordination value, repositioning destroys it. Movement signals either (a) the initial position was wrong, or (b) the founder lacks conviction. Either interpretation damages stakeholder coordination. Porter (1996) extends: "trade-offs create the need for choice and protect against repositioners."

**¶14** Van den Steen's framework assumes the committed position is correct. Under this assumption, commitment's coordination benefits outweigh its rigidity costs. But what if the assumption fails? In entrepreneurial contexts, uncertainty is high enough that the initial position is rarely optimal. The question becomes: does commitment to a wrong position still create value?

**¶15** I propose that Van den Steen's mechanism remains valid, but his scope condition does not hold in nascent ventures. Commitment creates coordination value—but only when the *object* of commitment is appropriate. In high-uncertainty environments, the object that merits commitment shifts from *static position* to *movement*.

**¶16** I define Movement as M = |ΔV|, the magnitude of change in strategic vagueness between two time points. A venture "moves" when it zooms in (reduces vagueness, increasing precision) or zooms out (increases vagueness, expanding scope) based on evidence.

**¶17** Movement is not random pivoting. It is disciplined repositioning—Bayesian updating of strategic position based on evidence. This distinction matters: random pivoting destroys coordination value (as Van den Steen predicts), but disciplined movement may preserve it by signaling *commitment to learning* rather than *commitment to a fixed position*.

**¶18** Three movement types emerge: stayers (M≈0), zoom-in (M>0, ΔV<0), and zoom-out (M>0, ΔV>0). Each represents a different *structure* of commitment, not a different *level* of commitment.

**¶19** If dG/dM > 0, Van den Steen's framework extends rather than collapses. Commitment remains valuable, but *what* one commits to matters as much as *that* one commits. In established firms with known positions, committing to positions creates coordination value. In nascent ventures with uncertain positions, committing to *movement*—the capacity to reposition based on evidence—may create more value.

**¶20** The empirical question is now precise: controlling for initial conditions, do ventures that move outperform those that stay? Module M2 tests this directly.
