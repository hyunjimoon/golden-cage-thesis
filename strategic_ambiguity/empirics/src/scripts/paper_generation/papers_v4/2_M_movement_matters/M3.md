# M3: Bridge (Decomposition)

**¶30 | Keystone | Outputs: Bridge Memo for M4+, T1-T4**

---

**¶30** The funding paradox decomposes into two testable claims. First, movement predicts growth: ventures that reposition outperform those that stay fixed (dG/dM > 0). Second, funding suppresses movement: capital commits founders to their funded vision (dM/dE < 0). Modules M4-M5 test the funding-movement relationship; Modules T1-T4 explain *how* funding traps ventures at both extremes of vagueness. The decomposition dG/dE = (dG/dM)(dM/dE) structures what follows.

## M3 Bridge Memo

```yaml
M3_BRIDGE_MEMO:
  decomposition:
    left_side: "dG/dE < 0 (paradox)"
    right_side: "(dG/dM > 0) × (dM/dE < 0)"

  assignments:
    M4: "Identify learning-acting gap (extends Camuffo-Nanda)"
    M5: "Test dM/dE < 0 empirically"
    T1: "Define traps + learning condition"
    T2: "High-V trap (too vague → can't learn)"
    T3: "Low-V trap (too specific → can't pivot)"
    T4: "Synthesis: both extremes trap"

  constraints:
    - "All agents must use M = |ΔV|"
    - "Trap = bidirectional (High-V and Low-V)"
    - "Types: stayer, mover (zoom_in), mover (zoom_out)"

  handoff_to:
    - M4, M5, T1, T2, T3, T4
