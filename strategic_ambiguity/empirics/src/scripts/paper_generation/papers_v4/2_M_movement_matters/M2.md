# M2: Empirics (Testing dG/dM > 0)

**¶21-29 | Validates Movement Principle | 9¶**

**¶21** Van den Steen's framework generates a clear prediction: if commitment to position creates coordination value, stayers should outperform movers. I test this prediction using 408,697 ventures from PitchBook (2010-2023).

**¶22** Movement M is computed as |ΔV|, where V is strategic vagueness derived from company descriptions at two time points. Growth G is operationalized as reaching Later Stage VC (Series C/D+)—a survival threshold that filters noise from early-stage failures unrelated to strategy.

**¶23** The core finding: movers outperform stayers 1.8×. Ventures with M > 0 show 18.0% survival versus 9.9% for stayers. The relationship holds across industries, cohorts, and funding levels.

**¶24** Regression confirms: a one-standard-deviation increase in M predicts 7.3 percentage points higher survival probability (p < 0.001), controlling for funding amount, industry, and founding year.

**¶25** Direction matters. Zoom-in ventures (ΔV < 0) achieve 17.5% survival. Zoom-out ventures (ΔV > 0) achieve 18.4%. Both outperform stayers, but through different mechanisms.

**¶26** The finding challenges Van den Steen's scope, not his mechanism. Movers outperform stayers 1.8×. If commitment to position creates value, why do ventures that reposition succeed more often? The answer cannot be that commitment has no value—Van den Steen's logic about coordination remains sound. The answer must be that in entrepreneurial contexts, committing to *movement* dominates committing to *static position*.

**¶26a** Why extend Van den Steen rather than Porter? Porter's positioning framework addresses *where* to compete—which industry position maximizes competitive advantage. Van den Steen addresses *why* commitment creates value—coordination among stakeholders. I extend the mechanism, not the content. Porter assumes the optimal position can be identified through external analysis; my finding suggests that in entrepreneurial contexts, the position itself must be discovered through movement. The mechanism of commitment (Van den Steen) remains valid; the object of commitment shifts from static position to adaptive capacity.

**¶27** Alternative explanations: perhaps movers are simply better founders? I address this with cohort fixed effects and propensity score matching. The movement premium persists.

**¶28** Perhaps movement proxies for learning? This is not an alternative—it is the mechanism. Movement reflects evidence-based updating. Stayers either lack evidence or ignore it. The question shifts: if movement helps, why do some ventures stay fixed?

**¶29** The Movement Principle (dG/dM > 0) is established. Module M4-M5 investigates why funding suppresses movement—creating the paradox that capital, meant to enable learning, can prevent acting on what is learned.
