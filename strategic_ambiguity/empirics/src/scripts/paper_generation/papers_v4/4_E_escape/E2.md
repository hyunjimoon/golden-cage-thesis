# E2: Stayer Examples (Lock-in Mechanisms)

**¶87-92 | Rubedos, Motional, TuSimple | 6¶**

**¶87** Stayers and movers face identical uncertainty. The difference lies not in information but in commitment structure. Funding acts as an identity contract—the specificity of capital, not its volume, determines whether movement remains possible.

**¶88** **Grant lock-in: Rubedos.** This Lithuanian robotics firm maintained "mobile robotics / missioning / machine vision" identity for 15+ years. Minimal VC (~$0.5M seed), but significant EU Structural Funds tied to specific projects: robotic disinfection, vision-guided forklifts, mission-specific applications. Grant capital is legally binding. Funds cannot be reallocated to platformization. Result: V₀ = 81.9 → V_T = 81.9, ΔV = 0. Long survival, limited growth (G = 2.6×).

**¶89** **Corporate lock-in: Motional.** The $4B Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture exemplifies the strongest form of inertia. Strategy is legally and operationally tethered to Hyundai's vehicle platform, integration roadmaps, and internal politics. Repeated commercialization delays followed. The venture cannot pivot to general AI or alternative markets. 40% layoffs in 2024 confirmed the trap—but movement remained impossible because the identity contract was embedded in the corporate structure.

**¶90** **Public market lock-in: TuSimple.** With ~$1.35B IPO capital, the identity was fixed in the prospectus: "Autonomous Freight Network." Technical and governance breakdowns accumulated. Deviation would create legitimacy and governance crises. The desperation pivot to generative AI came post-collapse—too late. TuSimple is the canonical warning case: public capital creates the most rigid identity contract.

**¶91** The three lock-in mechanisms share a common structure. Grant lock-in binds through legal deliverables. Corporate lock-in binds through strategic interdependence. Public lock-in binds through investor expectations and regulatory disclosure. All suppress dM/dE < 0 through different channels, same result: M ≈ 0.

**¶92** The stayer archetype is not a strategy—it's a symptom. No founder chooses to stay stuck. But funding structures create identity contracts that freeze movement. The paradox: capital enables growth in principle, but the commitment required to obtain capital impedes the movement that enables growth.
