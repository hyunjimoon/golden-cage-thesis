# E2: Stayer Examples (Lock-in Mechanisms)

**¶87-92 | Rubedos, Motional, TuSimple | 6¶**

**¶87** Stayers and movers face identical uncertainty. The difference lies not in information but in commitment structure. Funding acts as an identity contract—the specificity of capital, not its volume, determines whether repositioning remains possible. The World Economic Forum (2025) identifies a key pattern: "AV companies' core business is yet to become sustainable," despite billions deployed. This section examines why some ventures cannot move.

**¶88** **Grant lock-in: Rubedos.** This Lithuanian robotics firm maintained "mobile robotics / missioning / machine vision" identity for 15+ years. Minimal VC (~$0.5M seed), but significant EU Structural Funds tied to specific projects: robotic disinfection, vision-guided forklifts, mission-specific applications. Grant capital is legally binding. Funds cannot be reallocated to platformization. Result: B₀ = 81.9 → B_T = 81.9, R = 0, A = 0. Long survival, limited growth (G = 2.6×).

**¶89** **Corporate lock-in: Motional.** The $4B Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture exemplifies the strongest form of inertia. Strategy is legally and operationally tethered to Hyundai's vehicle platform, integration roadmaps, and internal politics. Motional ranks second in industry capital deployment (~$1.2B per industry_capital.png), yet sits in the "Upcoming Commercial" phase (motional_industry.png)—not yet profitable. Repeated commercialization delays followed: 2025 → 2027. The venture cannot pivot to general AI or alternative markets. 40% layoffs in 2024 confirmed the trap—but repositioning remained impossible because the identity contract was embedded in the corporate structure. A ≈ 0 despite crisis signals.

**¶90** **Public market lock-in: TuSimple.** With ~$1.35B IPO capital, the identity was fixed in the prospectus: "Autonomous Freight Network." Technical and governance breakdowns accumulated. Deviation would create legitimacy and governance crises. The desperation pivot to generative AI came post-collapse—too late. TuSimple is the canonical warning case: public capital creates the most rigid identity contract. McKinsey (2024) notes that "regulatory approval for autonomous technology in public markets" compounds the lock-in—changing strategy means re-filing, re-disclosing, re-explaining to analysts.

**¶91** The three lock-in mechanisms share a common structure:

| Lock-in Type | Binding Mechanism | Motional Relevance |
|:-------------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| **Grant** | Legal deliverables | Limited |
| **Corporate** | Strategic interdependence | Primary constraint |
| **Public** | Investor expectations + disclosure | Future risk if IPO |

All suppress dA/dF < 0 through different channels, same result: A ≈ 0. The mechanism operates through stakeholder constituency: each funding type creates a different group whose interests become tied to the funded strategy.

**¶92** The stayer archetype is not a strategy—it's a symptom. No founder chooses to stay stuck. But funding structures create identity contracts that freeze repositioning. The paradox: capital enables growth in principle, but the commitment required to obtain capital impedes the repositioning that enables growth. Motional's $4B represents both opportunity and anchor—the question is whether PAE strategies (Section E3) can loosen the lock-in before crisis forces movement.
