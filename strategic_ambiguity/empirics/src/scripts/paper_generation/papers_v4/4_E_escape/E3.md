# E3: Mover Examples (Agile vs Forced Movement)

**¶93** Movers escape traps through deliberate repositioning. Two patterns emerge: agile movers who maintain low early funding to preserve optionality, and forced movers who accumulate high funding then pivot under crisis. Both achieve M > 0, but through different mechanisms.

**¶94** **Agile mover: Sky Engine.** In 2021, identity was "AI models for autonomous vehicles, drones, robots"—moderately specific, endpoint-oriented (V₀ = 28.4). By 2025, identity shifted to "Synthetic Data Cloud for Vision AI"—hardware-decoupled, platform-level, high vagueness (V_T = 89.1). ΔV = +60.7. Funding was minimal early (~$1.2-2M seed) before Series A (~$7M). The long low-E period preserved freedom to redefine identity. Founders identified a second-order bottleneck (data scarcity, bias, safety) and pivoted "up the stack" from models to infrastructure. Result: G = 215.9×.

**¶95** **Forced mover: Nuro.** With ~$2.13B VC (SoftBank, Tiger Global), capital funded a manufacturing identity—delivery pods, factory buildout, hardware-centric operations. The strategy became unsustainable. In 2024, Nuro announced pivot to "Nuro Driver" licensing platform. Identity shifted from "delivery robot manufacturer" to "L4 autonomy software provider." High E created lock-in; only collapse released movement. The crisis-induced pivot proves that dM/dF < 0 can be overcome—but at enormous cost.

**¶96** Both strategies succeed through movement, but mechanisms differ. Sky Engine's agile movement was enabled by low early E—founders retained optionality to redefine identity before capital crystallized commitments. Nuro's forced movement required crisis—the hardware strategy had to fail visibly before the identity contract could be renegotiated. Same principle (M > 0 beats M ≈ 0), different pathways.

**¶97** The mover's secret: expectation management. Sky Engine maintained ambiguity in early investor communications, preserving room to pivot. Nuro's high-profile capital came with high-profile expectations—movement required visible failure first. Aurora provides a boundary condition: by maintaining high-vagueness identity ("Aurora Driver") from inception despite large funding, expectation management can mitigate dM/dF < 0.

**¶98** The prescription follows from mechanism. Founders seeking agile movement should delay large capital until identity has crystallized through learning. Founders already locked into high E face a harder path: either manage expectations proactively (Aurora model) or accept that movement may require crisis (Nuro model). The identity contract is the binding constraint.
