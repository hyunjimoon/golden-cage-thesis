# E4: Synthesis (Two Paths to Escape)

**¶99-104 | Agile vs Forced Movement | 6¶**

---

**¶99** Escape requires movement, but two paths exist. Sky Engine moved early with low funding; Nuro moved late after crisis. Both achieved M > 0. The common element: repositioning eventually happened. The difference: cost and timing.

**¶100** **The Agile Path.** Sky Engine maintained low early funding (~$2M seed) for years before Series A. This preserved freedom to redefine identity—from "AI models for autonomous vehicles" to "Synthetic Data Cloud." The long low-E period meant no identity contract had crystallized. Movement was cheap, voluntary, and evidence-based. Result: ΔV = +60.7, G = 215.9×.

**¶101** **The Forced Path.** Nuro accumulated $2.13B before movement became possible. Capital funded a hardware identity—delivery pods, factory buildout. The identity contract was locked. Movement required crisis: the hardware strategy had to fail visibly before investors would accept pivot to software licensing. Result: movement happened, but at enormous cost (layoffs, write-downs, reputation damage).

**¶102** The path depends on funding stage, not strategic preference. Early-stage ventures can choose the Agile Path—delay large capital until identity has crystallized through learning. Late-stage ventures with high E face the Forced Path—either manage expectations proactively or accept that movement may require crisis.

**¶103** Aurora provides a boundary condition. Despite large funding, Aurora maintained high-vagueness identity ("Aurora Driver") from inception. The lesson: expectation management can mitigate dM/dE < 0. If you must raise large capital early, preserve identity ambiguity in investor communications. The identity contract is negotiable—but only before capital closes.

**¶104** The prescription synthesizes: (1) **Diagnose** your E level—are you pre- or post-lock-in? (2) **If pre-lock-in**: delay large capital, preserve optionality, move when evidence arrives. (3) **If post-lock-in**: manage expectations (Aurora model) or prepare for crisis-induced movement (Nuro model). (4) **In all cases**: recruit stakeholders who enable movement, not just those who fund position. Commit to movement, not to the promises that funded you.

E4_SYNTHESIS:
  escape_paths:
    agile: "Low E → preserve optionality → voluntary movement"
    forced: "High E → lock-in → crisis → involuntary movement"
  exemplars:
    agile: "Sky Engine (ΔV=+60.7, G=215.9×)"
    forced: "Nuro ($2.13B → crisis → pivot)"
    boundary: "Aurora (High E + expectation management)"
  principle: "Both paths achieve M > 0, but Agile path is cheaper"
  prescription:
    - "Diagnose E level (pre- vs post-lock-in)"
    - "If pre-lock-in: delay capital, preserve optionality"
    - "If post-lock-in: manage expectations or accept crisis"
    - "Recruit movement-enabling stakeholders"
