# E1: TEMPO (Return to Funding Paradox)

**¶81-86 | With New Understanding | 6¶**

---

**¶81** We return to the Funding Paradox with new understanding. The decomposition dG/dF = (dG/dA) × (dA/dF) is now complete. Repositioning predicts growth (dG/dA > 0, Paper M). Funding suppresses repositioning through stakeholder lock-in (dA/dF < 0, Paper B). The paradox is explained: the product of a positive and a negative is negative.

**¶82** But explanation is not prescription. Understanding *why* funding traps ventures does not tell ventures *how* to escape. This chapter examines escape routes—the strategies that allow some ventures to break free from funding traps. The autonomous vehicle industry provides a natural laboratory: $26.2 billion deployed across the sector (industry_capital.png), yet predictions have consistently "tended to be overly optimistic" (World Economic Forum, 2025). The gap between capital deployed and commercial outcomes exemplifies the Funding Paradox at industry scale.

**¶83** Three patterns emerge from the data:

| Type | Definition | Survival | Mechanism |
|:-----|:-----------|:--------:|:----------|
| **Stayer** | A ≈ 0 | 9.9% | Trapped by lock-in |
| **Zoom-In** | R < 0 (B decreases) | 17.5% | Escapes high-B₀ trap |
| **Zoom-Out** | R > 0 (B increases) | 18.4% | Escapes low-B₀ trap |

Direction matters less than magnitude—both mover types outperform stayers by approximately 1.82×. The prescription follows from diagnosis: ventures must move, and the direction depends on their initial breadth position.

**¶84** The escape prescription follows from trap diagnosis. High-B₀ ventures (mobility: B₀ = 78) need zoom-in—forcing specificity to enable learning. Low-B₀ ventures (biotech, deep tech) need zoom-out—adding flexibility to enable pivoting. McKinsey (2024) documents that "2023 was a tipping point" for autonomous vehicles—not toward commercial success, but toward industry-wide timeline revision. Predictions shifted from 2025 to 2027-2030. This collective recalibration represents industry-level learning, but individual ventures must translate industry learning into firm-level repositioning.

**¶85** Mobility ventures exemplify the high-B₀ trap and its consequences. With 91% stayer ratio and 5% survival, they demonstrate what happens when capital requirements block the experiments needed to zoom in. The industry has evolved through three phases (motional_industry.png): Early R&D (pre-2018), Capital Deployment (2018-2023), and Commercial Transition (2024+). Ventures founded in the Capital Deployment phase face a double bind: they need flexibility (high uncertainty remains) but must commit (to secure continued funding). Section E2 examines these stuck ventures.

**¶86** But some ventures escape. McKinsey (2024) reports that 96% of industry executives see partnerships as "crucial or very important"—this consensus suggests Platformization as an escape mechanism. Section E3 examines movers who escaped through the PAE framework (Platformize → Acculturate → Evaluate). Section E4 synthesizes the two paths: Agile escape (low F, preserved optionality) versus Forced escape (high F, crisis-driven repositioning). Motional, with $4B committed and positioned second in industry capital deployment, faces a critical choice: proactive repositioning now or crisis-driven repositioning later.
