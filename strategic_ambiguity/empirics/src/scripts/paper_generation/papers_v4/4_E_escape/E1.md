# E1: TEMPO (Return to Funding Paradox)

**¶81-86 | With New Understanding | 6¶**

---

**¶81** We return to the Funding Paradox with new understanding. The decomposition dG/dE = (dG/dM)(dM/dE) is now complete. Movement predicts growth (M module). Funding suppresses movement through High-V and Low-V traps (T module). The paradox is explained.

**¶82** But explanation is not prescription. Understanding why funding traps ventures does not tell ventures how to escape. This module examines escape routes—the strategies that allow some ventures to break free.

**¶83** Three patterns emerge from the data:
- **Stayer** (M≈0): trapped, 9.9% survival
- **Mover (Zoom In)** (M>0, ΔV<0): escapes high-V trap, 17.5% survival
- **Mover (Zoom Out)** (M>0, ΔV>0): escapes low-V trap, 18.4% survival

**¶84** The escape prescription follows from trap diagnosis. High-V ventures (mobility: V₀=78) need zoom-in—forcing specificity to enable learning. Low-V ventures (biotech, deep tech) need zoom-out—adding flexibility to enable pivoting.

**¶85** Mobility ventures exemplify the high-V trap and its consequences. With 91% stayer ratio and 5% survival, they demonstrate what happens when capital requirements block the experiments needed to zoom in. Module E2 examines these stuck ventures.

**¶86** But some ventures escape. Module E3 examines movers—ventures that moved early with low funding (Sky Engine) or pivoted after crisis (Nuro)—to identify escape mechanisms. Module E4 synthesizes the two paths to success.
