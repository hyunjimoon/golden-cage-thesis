# C2: Boundary (Limitations & New Problems)

**¶109-112 | Future Research | 4¶**

---

**¶109** **Limitation—selection bias**: Successful zoom-in ventures "graduate" from early-stage datasets. They reach Later Stage VC and exit our observation window. What remains observable are stayers who haven't escaped. This understates the zoom-in survival premium—the actual advantage may be larger than 1.8×.

**¶110** **Limitation—generalizability**: The mobility finding (V₀=78, 91% stayer, 5% survival) may not extend to all high-capital industries. Replication in biotech, cleantech, and deep tech is needed. The High-V vs Low-V trap distinction requires validation across contexts where vagueness distributions differ.

**¶111** **New problem—investor behavior change**: If funding traps ventures, how should VC practices evolve? The industry selects for vision alignment; my findings suggest selecting for belief diversity. This requires institutional change: restructured due diligence, new syndication patterns, different milestone structures. The gap between evidence and practice remains wide.

**¶112** **New problem—trap detection**: Can we identify traps before they form? Early warning indicators—belief variance collapse, escalation language in updates, metric obsession disconnected from learning—deserve systematic study. Real-time V measurement could enable intervention before traps lock in.
