## Core Construct: Parallel Experimentation → Strategic Convergence

> 벤처가 시장 불확실성 해소를 위해 복수의 자원 배분 경로를 병렬적으로 시작(Parallel Experimentation)한 뒤, 증거에 기반하여 범위를 체계적으로 축소(Strategic Convergence)하고 최고 잠재력 경로에 몰입하는 동적 전략 프로세스.

**측정**: M = |ΔV| (Vagueness 변화의 절대값)

## P1: The Funding Paradox (¶01-11)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 01 | Strategy theory and investment practice share an implicit assumption: capital enables commitment... |
| 02 | **I find the opposite.** Ventures that raise more funding show *lower* growth rates. |
| 03 | This paper explains why. The answer lies in movement. |
| 04 | **The decomposition: dG/dE = (dG/dM) × (dM/dE).** |
| 05 | I define three variables: E, M, G. |
| 06 | Movement is not pivoting randomly. It is disciplined repositioning. |
| 07 | The null hypothesis comes from strategy theory. |
| 08 | **My finding challenges this implicit assumption.** Movers outperform stayers 1.8×. |
| 09 | Three patterns emerge: stayers, zoom-in, zoom-out. |
| 10 | Traps occur at both extremes. |
| 11 | **The prescription: commit to movement, not to the promises that fund it.** |

## M1: Strategy Gospel (¶12-20)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 12 | Van den Steen (2017) formalizes why commitment creates strategic value. |
| 13 | This logic has profound implications. If commitment creates coordination value, repositioning destroys it. |
| 14 | Van den Steen's framework assumes the committed position is correct. |
| 15 | **I propose that Van den Steen's mechanism remains valid, but his scope condition does not hold.** |
| 16 | I define Movement as M = \|ΔV\|. |
| 17 | Movement is not random pivoting. It is disciplined repositioning—Bayesian updating. |
| 18 | Three movement types emerge: stayers, zoom-in, zoom-out. |
| 19 | **If dG/dM > 0, Van den Steen's framework extends rather than collapses.** |
| 20 | The empirical question is now precise. |

---

## M2: Empirics (¶21-29)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 21 | Van den Steen's framework generates a clear prediction: stayers should outperform movers. |
| 22 | Movement M is computed as \|ΔV\|. Growth G = Later Stage VC. |
| 23 | **The core finding: movers outperform stayers 1.8×.** |
| 24 | Regression confirms: +7.3 pp survival per 1 SD movement. |
| 25 | Direction matters. Zoom-in: 17.5%. Zoom-out: 18.4%. |
| 26 | **The finding challenges Van den Steen's scope, not his mechanism.** |
| 26a | Why extend Van den Steen rather than Porter? |
| 27 | Alternative explanations: perhaps movers are simply better founders? |
| 28 | Perhaps movement proxies for learning? This is not an alternative—it is the mechanism. |
| 29 | The Movement Principle (dG/dM > 0) is established. |

## M3: Bridge (¶30)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 30 | **The funding paradox decomposes into two testable claims.** |

---

## M4: Bayesian Gospel (¶31-39)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 31 | Entrepreneurship is experimentation. Camuffo and colleagues formalized this. |
| 32 | I test this assumption. If capital enables experimentation, then dM/dE > 0. |
| 33 | **I find the opposite. Funding suppresses movement: dM/dE < 0.** |
| 34 | **This is not Camuffo-Nanda being wrong. It is Camuffo-Nanda being incomplete.** |
| 35 | Capital creates commitment through three channels: psychological, structural, social. |
| 36 | Consider the founder who raises $5M. |
| 37 | **This extends experimental entrepreneurship.** Capital enables in principle; commitment impedes in practice. |
| 38 | Heterogeneity supports this. dM/dE < 0 strongest when commitment strongest. |
| 39 | Module M5 tests the core claim. |

---

## M5: Empirics (¶40-48)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 40 | I now test whether funding suppresses strategic movement. |
| 41 | Using 408,697 ventures from PitchBook. |
| 42 | **Core finding: +1 SD funding → 0.4 SD lower movement.** |
| 43 | Causal identification uses funding shocks. |
| 44 | Mechanism test: dM/dE < 0 effect is 2× stronger for commitment-heavy deals. |
| 45 | Timing matters. Early-stage funding shows stronger dM/dE < 0. |
| 46 | The pattern is consistent with commitment constraining experimentation. |
| 47 | **Summary: The Funding Trap is empirically confirmed.** |
| 48 | The Camuffo-Nanda framework is now extended. |

## T1: Coords (¶49-56)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 49 | The Funding Trap operates through two mechanisms. |
| 50 | **I frame traps as process failures, not outcome failures.** |
| 51 | Traps occur at both extremes of vagueness. |
| 52 | **The learning condition formalizes this: μ(1−μ) < ε/V.** |
| 53 | Funding accelerates trap formation through two pathways. |
| 54 | Each mechanism has distinct signature. |
| 55 | The E×E matrix maps trap probability. |
| 56 | Modules T2-T3 detail each mechanism. |

---

## T2: High-V Trap (¶57-64)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 57 | **The high-V trap operates through unfalsifiability.** |
| 58 | The learning condition formalizes this: μ(1−μ) < ε/V. |
| 59 | High-V founders attract believers who share their grand vision. |
| 60 | **The flexibility trap paradox: vagueness preserves options but prevents learning.** |
| 61 | The mechanism has two components: internal and external. |
| 62 | Data shows the pattern. High-V ventures show more vision alignment but less movement. |
| 63 | **High-V ventures need to zoom in. But investors reward vagueness.** |
| 64 | **Escape requires forcing specificity before funding.** |

---

## T3: Low-V Trap (¶65-72)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 65 | **The low-V trap operates through commitment lock-in.** |
| 66 | Staw's (1976) escalation research explains the mechanism. |
| 67 | The echo chamber forms naturally. |
| 68 | **The learning condition applies: μ(1−μ) < ε/V. Low V raises threshold, but variance collapses.** |
| 69 | Data confirms the pattern. |
| 70 | Examples illustrate: biotech, deep tech. |
| 71 | **The trap is particularly dangerous because it looks like success.** |
| 72 | **Escape requires belief diversity before funding.** |

---

## T4: Synthesis (¶73-80)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 73 | **Both extremes trap ventures.** |
| 74 | The unified trap equation: μ(1−μ) < ε/V captures both failures. |
| 75 | **Funding accelerates both traps.** |
| 76 | This completes the dM/dE < 0 mechanism. |
| 77 | Data shows the pattern across industries. |
| 78 | The stayer archetype has two origins. |
| 79 | **Escape requires different prescriptions.** High-V: specificity. Low-V: diversity. |
| 80 | The funding paradox is now explained. |

---

## E1: TEMPO (¶81-86)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 81 | **We return to the Funding Paradox with new understanding.** |
| 82 | But explanation is not prescription. |
| 83 | Three patterns emerge: stayer, zoom-in, zoom-out. |
| 84 | The escape prescription follows from trap diagnosis. |
| 85 | Mobility ventures exemplify the high-V trap. |
| 86 | But some ventures escape. |

---

## E2: Stayer Examples (¶87-92)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 87 | **Stayers and movers face identical uncertainty. The difference lies in commitment structure.** |
| 88 | Mobility ventures exemplify the stayer pattern. |
| 89 | The high-V stayer mechanism: vision investors reward grand narratives. |
| 90 | The data shows the pattern. |
| 91 | Low-V stayers face the mirror trap. |
| 92 | **The stayer archetype is not a strategy—it's a symptom.** |

---

## E3: Mover Examples (¶93-98)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 93 | **Movers escape traps through deliberate repositioning.** |
| 94 | **Agile mover: Sky Engine.** (Low E → ΔV=+60.7 → G=216×) |
| 95 | **Forced mover: Nuro.** ($2.1B → crisis → pivot) |
| 96 | **Both strategies succeed through deliberate movement.** |
| 97 | **The mover's secret: belief variance.** |
| 98 | Industry patterns emerge. |

---

## E4: Synthesis (¶99-104)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 99 | **Escape requires movement, but not specific direction.** |
| 100 | Two strategic archetypes emerge: architect (zoom in) and value chain (zoom out). |
| 101 | The value chain strategy: become a platform. |
| 102 | Neither strategy is universally superior. |
| 103 | Implementation requires institutional support. |
| 104 | **The prescription synthesizes: Diagnose → Identify → Choose → Recruit.** |

---

## C1: Implications (¶105-108)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 105 | **[Founders] The world you live in: you raised capital to accelerate learning, but...** |
| 106 | **[Founders] A hypothesis worth testing: separate internal compass from external pitch.** |
| 107 | **[Investors] Your conviction alignment may be a risk factor, not a strength.** |
| 108 | **[Investors] Structure terms that permit pivoting.** |

---

## C2: Boundary (¶109-112)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 109 | **Limitation—selection bias:** Successful zoom-in ventures "graduate" from dataset. |
| 110 | **Limitation—generalizability:** Mobility finding may not extend everywhere. |
| 111 | **New problem—investor behavior change:** VC practices need restructuring. |
| 112 | **New problem—trap detection:** Can we identify traps before they form? |

---

## C3: CODA (¶113)

| ¶ | First Sentence (Core Claim) |
|:--|:----------------------------|
| 113 | **Contributions.** Layer 1: M = \|ΔV\|, dG/dM > 0, dM/dE < 0. Layer 2: decomposition. Layer 3: learning trap condition. **必死卽生, 必生卽死.** |
