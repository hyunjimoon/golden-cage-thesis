# T4: Synthesis (Both Extremes Trap)

**¶73-80 | Completing dM/dE < 0 | 8¶**

---

**¶73** Both extremes trap ventures. Too vague (high-V): hypotheses are unfalsifiable, learning cannot identify what to reject. Too specific (low-V): commitment locks in direction, pivoting betrays believers. The stayer pattern emerges from both mechanisms.

**¶74** The unified trap equation: μ(1−μ) < ε/V captures both failures. High-V traps fail on the right side—no clear prediction to test. Low-V traps fail on the left side—belief variance collapses to zero.

**¶75** Funding accelerates both traps. High-V ventures attract "vision" investors who reward staying vague. Low-V ventures attract "execution" investors who punish pivoting. Capital selects for the investors who will cage you.

**¶76** This completes the dM/dE < 0 mechanism. Funding doesn't directly suppress movement—it selects for stakeholders whose incentives resist movement. The trap is structural, not intentional.

**¶77** Data shows the pattern across industries. Mobility (high-V): 91% stayer, 5% survival. Biotech (low-V subset): high milestone achievement, low pivot success. Both extremes underperform movers.

**¶78** The stayer archetype (M≈0) has two origins. Some stayers are trapped at high-V—unable to zoom in. Others are trapped at low-V—unable to zoom out. Same outcome, different mechanisms.

**¶79** Escape requires different prescriptions. High-V traps need forced specificity before funding—testable hypotheses that can fail. Low-V traps need forced diversity—doubters who preserve belief variance.

**¶80** The funding paradox is now explained. dG/dE < 0 because (dG/dM > 0) × (dM/dE < 0). Movement predicts growth; funding suppresses movement through the twin traps of flexibility and commitment. Module E examines escape routes.
