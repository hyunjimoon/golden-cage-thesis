# T3: Low-V Trap (Commitment Trap)

**¶65-72 | Too Specific → Hard to Pivot | 8¶**

---

**¶65** **Low-V trap mechanism: 몰입 고착 → pivot 불능.** When ventures commit too specifically, their precise promises attract believers who expect exactly that outcome. Pivoting means betraying the very people who funded you.

**¶66** Staw's (1976) escalation research explains the mechanism. Decision-makers "become locked into a course of action" when personally responsible for the initial investment. Funding amplifies this—founders who raise capital on specific promises have publicly committed, making reversal costly to identity, not just strategy.

**¶67** The echo chamber forms naturally. Precise visions attract investors who believe that exact thesis. Due diligence rewards founders who "know their answer." Doubt gets filtered out; agreement concentrates.

**¶68** The learning condition applies: **μ(1−μ) < ε/V**. Low V raises the threshold—but the real problem is belief homogenization. When everyone agrees, variance μ(1−μ) approaches zero. No amount of evidence can update a unanimous prior.

**¶69** Data confirms the pattern. Ventures with more precise initial positioning show higher investor-founder alignment but lower survival when market conditions shift. They hit their specific targets but missed the actual opportunity.

**¶70** Examples illustrate. Biotech ventures locked into specific indications. Deep tech ventures committed to particular applications. Each attracted funding for precision—then couldn't adapt when evidence suggested pivoting.

**¶71** The trap is particularly dangerous because it looks like success. Hitting milestones feels like progress. Investor enthusiasm feels like validation. The venture is winning its defined game while losing the real one.

**¶72** Escape requires belief diversity before funding. Add a doubter—an investor or advisor who challenges the specific thesis. Their disagreement preserves the variance needed for learning when evidence demands change.
