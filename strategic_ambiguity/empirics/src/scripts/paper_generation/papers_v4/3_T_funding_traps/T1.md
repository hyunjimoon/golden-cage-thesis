# T1: Coords (What Are Traps?)

**¶49-56 | Setup for High-V and Low-V Traps | 8¶**

---

**¶49** The Funding Trap (dM/dE < 0) operates through two mechanisms. Both explain why capital, intended to enable learning, instead suppresses the movement that learning would produce.

**¶50** I frame traps as process failures, not outcome failures. A trap is a state where learning halts—where new evidence no longer updates beliefs or actions. The venture is stuck.

**¶51** Traps occur at both extremes of vagueness. High-V traps: the venture stays too vague, unable to zoom in despite needing focus. Low-V traps: the venture stays too specific, unable to zoom out despite needing flexibility.

**¶52** The learning condition formalizes this: **μ(1−μ) < ε/V**. Here ε is the learning threshold (how much evidence is needed to update), and V is vagueness (inversely related to precision τ). When belief variance μ(1−μ) falls below ε/V, updating stops. The venture is trapped. Low V (high precision) raises the threshold, making traps more likely.

**¶53** Funding accelerates trap formation through two pathways: flexibility traps for high-V ventures (T2) and commitment traps for low-V ventures (T3).

**¶54** Each mechanism has distinct signature. High-V traps show unfalsifiable hypotheses and vision alignment without movement. Low-V traps show belief homogenization and milestone achievement without adaptation.

**¶55** The E×E matrix maps trap probability. First E = external funding level. Second E = epistemic diversity (belief variance). High funding + low diversity = maximum trap probability—regardless of vagueness level.

**¶56** Modules T2-T3 detail each mechanism. T4 synthesizes. The goal: understand not just that traps exist, but why they form differently at each extreme and how to escape.
