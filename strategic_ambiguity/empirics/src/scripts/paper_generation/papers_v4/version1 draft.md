7 Chapter 1 Introduction

Ventures frequently reposition their strategic focus as they learn from customers, markets, and technologies. Yet in a sample of 180,860 ventures observed from 2021 to 2025, we find that 53% never changed their market positioning. They neither focused nor broadened their stated scope. This stasis is puzzling because repositioning is strongly associated with growth: ventures that changed their positioning achieved median funding growth four to five times higher than those that remained fixed. Why do so many ventures forgo repositioning despite its apparent benefits?

This paper proposes and tests an explanation we call the Golden Cage. We document that early-stage funding is negatively correlated with subsequent repositioning. Ventures that raised more capital in initial rounds changed their positioning less, not more. This pattern contradicts the conventional view that capital enables experimentation and strategic flexibility. We argue that while capital provides operational resources, it simultaneously creates stakeholder obligations that constrain strategic change. Investors, board members, and customers expect the original positioning to persist McDonald and Gao (2019). Each relationship is a constraint; together, they form a cage.

Our analysis proceeds in two parts. First, we establish what we call the Movement Principle: repositioning, not initial positioning, predicts venture growth. Signaling theory suggests that precise positioning reduces information asymmetry and improves outcomes (Spence, 1973b). We find the opposite. The correlation between initial positioning vagueness and subsequent growth is positive, not negative. Moreover, the direction of repositioning does not matter: ventures that focused and ventures that broadened achieved similar growth rates. What distinguishes higher-growth ventures is whether they repositioned or not.

Second, we document the Golden Cage. If repositioning predicts growth, what predicts repositioning? Recent work frames entrepreneurship as scientific experimentation: entrepreneurs formulate hypotheses, test them, and update their strategies based on evidence (Camuffo et al., 2020; Stern & Camuffo, 2021) . Venture capitalists fund these experiments, providing capital explicitly intended to enable pivots, market tests, and iterative learning (Nanda, 2020). Under this view, more capital should produce more experimentation and more repositioning. Our data show the opposite: early funding correlates negatively with repositioning. Capital intended to enable learning may, paradoxically, constrain it.

9 We make three contributions. First, we present evidence against the monotonic prediction of signaling theory. This finding suggests that the information-theoretic benefits of precision may be offset by the option value of ambiguity. Second, we document that repositioning predicts growth independently of initial positioning. This result shifts attention from the question of optimal positioning to the question of adaptive capacity. Third, we identify a negative correlation between early capital and repositioning, which we interpret through a stakeholder constraint lens. This pattern complicates the view that resources straightforwardly enable experimentation.

Several scope conditions apply. We study positioning, defined as how ventures describe their market opportunity, not operational capability, defined as what ventures can actually do. These constructs are conceptually distinct: a venture may communicate broadly while possessing narrow capabilities, or vice versa. Our measure of repositioning captures changes in stated positioning over time. We study technology ventures that received early-stage funding between 2021 and 2025, using subsequent funding growth as our outcome measure. Our analysis is correlational; we discuss threats to causal inference and boundary conditions in the robustness section.

The remainder of this dissertation proceeds in three parts. Paper M establishes the Movement Principle, documenting that repositioning predicts growth. Paper C introduces the Golden Cage, showing that early capital correlates negatively with the repositioning that predicts growth. The Discussion synthesizes findings, addresses limitations, and proposes directions for future research.

10 Chapter 2 Paper M: The Movement Principle

2.1 Introduction

Does clearer strategic positioning always lead to better venture outcomes? Signaling theory posits that precision reduces information asymmetry and signals quality, implying a linear relationship between specificity and success. I challenge this assumption by analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 180,860 technology ventures (2021–2025). The results reject the linear model, revealing a multimodal distribution of success: ventures succeed either by being highly specific or by maintaining moderate vagueness. Crucially, I find that the success of the ambiguous group is driven by their adaptability. Movers—ventures that repositioned ( | D | > 0)—achieved a success rate of 18.1% compared to 7.0% for static peers (a 2.6× advantage). This study introduces the “Movement Principle,” demonstrating that in high-uncertainty environments, the primary value of an initial position lies not in its optimality, but in the option value it preserves for future movement.

2.1.1 The Signaling Prescription

Signaling theory provides the dominant framework for understanding how entrepreneurs communicate with investors. Spence (1973a) Spence (1973b) established that credible signals—costly to produce and correlated with unobservable quality—enable high-ability actors to separate themselves from low-ability imitators. Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that precise, verifiable promises reduce information asymmetry and improve venture outcomes. Founders who articulate specific technologies, measurable milestones, and concrete deliverables enable investors to assess quality directly. The “scientific approach” to entrepreneurship extends this logic, prescribing that founders formulate falsifiable hypotheses, gather evidence, and refine strategy based on validated learning (Gans et al., 2019; Stern, 2006). We formalize this conventional wisdom as our null hypothesis: promise vagueness monotonically reduces venture success.

2.1.2 The Empirical Puzzle

Our analysis of 180,860 technology ventures reveals a pattern that challenges this prescription. Success rates—measured as progression to Later Stage VC funding—do not decrease

11 monotonically with positioning vagueness. The Spearman rank correlation between initial vagueness (V ) and later success (L) is ρ = +0.024 (p < 0.001), directly contradict the negative correlation predicted by signaling theory. Success rates by quartile show Q1 (precise) at 12.3%, Q2 at 8.9%, Q3 at 16.0%, and Q4 (vague) at 12.9%. The highest success rate appears in Q3, not at either extreme—a pattern inconsistent with both signaling theory’s monotonic prediction and simple strategic ambiguity arguments that would favor Q4.

2.1.3 Research Question

This paper asks: when does positioning vagueness become valuable, and why does the relationship between vagueness and success appear non-monotonic? We test two competing predictions: signaling theory’s null hypothesis that vagueness monotonically reduces success (H 0 ), and an alternative hypothesis that the relationship is non-monotonic (H 1 ). More importantly, we examine whether strategic repositioning—movement—matters more than initial positioning. If vagueness creates options but options require exercise to generate value, then adaptation should predict success better than initial position.

2.1.4 The Movement Principle

Our most striking finding resolves the Q3 anomaly: what matters is not initial positioning but whether ventures adapt. Companies that repositioned (adaptive capacity A > 0) succeed at 18.1%, compared to 7.0% for those that stayed fixed—a 2.6× advantage. Q3’s high aggregate success (16.0%) is entirely explained by its high movement rate (68%); among stayers only, Q3 has the lowest success (6.6%). Direction matters little: focusing (D < 0) yields 17.6% success while broadening (D > 0) yields 18.6%. We term this the Movement Principle: vagueness buys options, but exercising options—not holding them—drives success.

2.1.5 Contributions

We make two contributions. First, we document patterns inconsistent with a simple monotonic prediction of signaling theory: the benefits of precision do not appear to increase without limit, and the success of moderately vague ventures is consistent with an option-value interpretation of ambiguity. Second, we show that repositioning—not initial positioning—predicts venture growth, while early capital is modestly negatively associated with repositioning, suggesting that adaptation rather than resourcing per se is the central margin of interest.

2.2 Theory

2.2.1 Signaling Theory as the Null Hypothesis

Signaling theory provides the dominant framework for understanding entrepreneurial communication with investors. Spence (1973a) established that credible signals—costly to produce and correlated with unobservable quality—enable high-ability actors to separate themselves from low-ability imitators. Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that precise,

12 verifiable promises reduce information asymmetry and improve venture outcomes (Connelly et al., 2011). In this view, vagueness represents noise: an inferior signal that either masks low ability or invites adverse selection. We formalize this conventional wisdom as our null hypothesis: promise vagueness monotonically reduces venture success.

2.2.2 Strategic Ambiguity as Flexibility Preservation

A contrasting perspective emerges from research on strategic ambiguity in organizational communication. Eisenberg (1984a) argues that ambiguity is not merely failed clarity but a deliberate communicative strategy serving multiple functions: promoting unified diversity, preserving future options, and enabling deniability. For entrepreneurs, vagueness may preserve strategic flexibility, support identity formation during market emergence, and reduce premature commitment to narrow niches that may prove unviable. This perspective suggests that the relationship between vagueness and outcomes may not be uniformly negative; strategic ambiguity may function as an instrument for maintaining degrees of freedom rather than merely degrading signal quality.

2.2.3 Real Options Theory and Entrepreneurial Experimentation

A third stream conceptualizes entrepreneurship as a process of experimentation and learning under uncertainty (Kerr et al., 2014; McGrath, 1997). Real options theory establishes that preserving strategic alternatives has value when the future is unknowable, and that premature commitment destroys this value (Kogut, 1991). We draw on this framework to reinterpret vagueness (V ) as a communicative analogue to commitment parameters: high vagueness preserves optionality but introduces evaluation noise, while low vagueness enables verification but constrains strategic flexibility.

2.2.4 The Gap: Options Without Exercise

Across these literatures, a common but largely untested assumption persists: the effect of vagueness on venture outcomes is monotonically negative. Most critically, no prior work tests whether exercising strategic options—movement—matters more than holding options—initial positioning. Real options theory suggests vagueness creates optionality, but options generate value only when exercised at appropriate moments. Our paper addresses this gap.

2.2.5 Core Mechanism: Projection and Audience Segmentation

Our theoretical mechanism builds on Eisenberg (1984b)’s foundational insight that ambiguity serves strategic functions beyond information transmission. Eisenberg identified “unified diversity” as a key benefit: ambiguous messages allow diverse audiences to find their own meaning, creating alignment without requiring agreement on specifics. In entrepreneurial contexts, this translates to what we term the “projection mechanism”—vague positioning allows investors to project their own visions of success onto the venture. Ghemawat (1991) provides the complementary commitment lens: strategic choices create path dependencies

13 that constrain future options. Together, these frameworks suggest that vagueness preserves optionality that precise commitments foreclose.

2.2.6 Hypotheses

We derive two primary hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1 (H1: Non-monotonicity). ρ (V, L) ≥ 0, rejecting the signaling theory prediction of monotonic decrease.

Hypothesis 2 (H2: Movement Principle). L(moved) > L(stayed): ventures that repositioned outperform static peers.

2.3 Empirics

2.3.1 Data and Sample Construction

We analyze technology ventures using PitchBook data covering 2021 to 2025. Our sample includes ventures that received early-stage funding (Series A and B) and for which we can observe positioning descriptions and subsequent funding outcomes. The final sample comprises 180,860 ventures with complete data on initial vagueness scores and later success indicators.

Linpowave exemplifies focusing: narrowing from broad radar applications to specific 4D radar use cases. Both Movers achieved repositioning; direction differed but movement itself distinguished them from Stayers.

2.3.3 Results: Rejecting Monotonicity

The Spearman rank correlation between initial vagueness (V ) and later success (L) is ρ = +0.024 (p < 0.001, 95% CI: [0.019, 0.029]). This positive correlation directly rejects signaling theory’s prediction of a monotonic decrease.

Success rates by quartile, with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals:

• Q1 (precise): 12.3% [11.8%, 12.8%]

• Q2: 8.9% [8.5%, 9.3%]

• Q3: 16.0% [15.4%, 16.6%]

• Q4 (vague): 12.9% [12.4%, 13.4%]

15 Result: H1 supported. The relationship is non-monotonic.

2.3.4 Results: The Movement Principle

Companies that repositioned (A > 0) succeed at 18.1% [17.5%, 18.7%], compared to 7.0% [6.6%, 7.4%] for those that stayed fixed—a 2.6× advantage ( χ 2 = 4, 891.3, p < 0.001).

Interpretable Effect Size:

• Number Needed to Treat (NNT): 1/0.111 ≈ 9. For every 9 ventures that reposition, approximately 1 additional venture achieves success.

• Relative Risk: Movers are 2.6× more likely to succeed (RR = 2.59, 95% CI: [2.42,

2.77]).

• Attributable Risk: 62% of mover success is attributable to movement itself. Result: H2 was strongly supported.

2.3.5 Results: Direction Irrelevance

Among movers, direction matters little:

• Focusing (D < 0): 17.6% [16.8%, 18.4%]

• Broadening (D > 0): 18.6% [17.8%, 19.4%]

Cohen’s h = 0.027 (negligible). The movement advantage (2.6×) is approximately 25 times larger than the directional effect. This supports the Movement Principle: what matters is whether ventures adapt, not in which direction.

16 2.4 Discussion

2.4.1 Summary of Findings

This paper documents three main findings. First, we reject signaling theory’s monotonic prediction: ρ = +0.024 ∗∗∗ . Second, we establish the Movement Principle: 2.6× advantage for movers. Third, we resolve the Q3 anomaly through differential movement rates.

2.4.2 Theoretical Implications

These findings reframe the vagueness debate from positioning to adaptation. Vagueness may create strategic options, consistent with real options theory (McGrath, 1999), but options generate value only when exercised. The Movement Principle suggests that the exercise component dominates the holding component. Our contribution extends beyond Zuckerman (1999)’s categorical penalty and Pontikes (2012)’s audience-dependent effects by showing that static versus dynamic positioning is the first-order distinction.

2.4.3 Practical Implications

For entrepreneurs:

17 1. Secure positioning flexibility early

2. Commit to adaptation as conditions warrant

3. Avoid over-optimizing initial positioning

The worst outcome is not wrong positioning but rather static positioning. Among stayers, even the best-positioned quartile achieved only 7.5% success—substantially underperforming movers in every quartile.

2.4.4 Limitations

Our primary limitation is the correlational nature of our evidence. We document associations but cannot establish causation. The 2.6× movement advantage could reflect reverse causality, selection effects, or omitted variables. We mitigate this through temporal stability analysis across the 2023-2025 market regimes.

2.4.5 Conclusion

Strategic ambiguity is not weakness; it is the preservation of options that must be exercised. The Movement Principle provides a clear answer: vagueness buys options, but success requires using them.

18 Chapter 3 Paper C: The Golden Cage

3.1 Introduction

A central prescription in entrepreneurial finance is that early capital enables venture success. Financial resources are often treated as a form of organizational slack: a buffer that absorbs shocks, extends runway, and makes experimentation and risk-taking feasible (Bourgeois; Nohria). In startup settings, this logic is frequently paired with the view that entrepreneurship is an experimentation process – founders test conjectures about customers and markets, update beliefs, and adjust course Agrawal et al., 2024; Camuffo et al., 2020. Under that combined view, early funding should be an enabler of learning: it should expand the space of experiments a venture can run and, when evidence warrants, make strategic change easier. Early capital can also plausibly help through signaling and recruiting: financing may certify venture’s quality to external stakeholders and attract the talent needed.

Our data reveal a pattern that is difficult to reconcile with that prescription. In a sample of 180,860 ventures receiving early-stage funding between 2021 and 2025, early funding is negatively correlated with later success. Using progression to later-stage venture financing as the primary outcome (L) and early funding as the focal predictor (E), the Spearman

correlation is ρ (E, L) = −0.211 (p < 0.001).

This paper focuses on one candidate mechanism: a potential friction between capital and strategic adaptation. Paper M established that repositioning—changing market positioning rather than remaining fixed—strongly predicts venture growth. That result implies a simple diagnostic: if strategic adaptation is a key driver of later performance, then anything systematically associated with reduced adaptive capacity may help explain why some ventures underperform. We therefore ask whether early capital is associated with reduced strategic adaptation. Let A denote adaptive capacity as captured by changes in a venture’s stated market positioning over time. If capital primarily expands slack, we would expect ρ (E, A) > 0; capital should fund experimentation and make change easier.

Instead, we observe the opposite sign: ρ (E, A) = −0.009 (p < 0.001). Ventures that raise more early capital reposition slightly less, not more. We call this potential mechanism the Golden Cage. The intuition is not that capital prevents action—capital enables action—but that it can also bundle commitments that raise the cost of changing course. Funding rounds create stakeholder relationships and expectations: investors back an initial thesis, early

19 customers adopt an initial roadmap, and early hires join for a particular mission. Over time, these commitments can harden into constraints, making repositioning costly even when new evidence suggests it would be valuable. The cage is golden because it provides resources; it is still a cage because resources can arrive with obligations.

Two clarifications are crucial. First, the capital-flexibility friction is statistically precise but economically small. A correlation of −0.009 explains less than 0.01% of the variance in A. Second, this friction is not the binding explanation for the Golden Cage. Even under generous assumptions that attribute the entire ρ (E, A) association to a causal effect of capital on adaptation, and that treat adaptation as a key pathway to later outcomes, simple decomposition implies that the capital–adaptation channel accounts for less than 1% of the negative ρ (E, L) relationship. In other words, while the Golden Cage pattern is present, it cannot, by itself, explain why well-funded ventures are less likely to progress. Other mechanisms—selection into funding, overfunding and burn dynamics, expectation management, or strategic commitment effects that operate through channels other than repositioning—must dominate.

This paper makes two contributions. First, it tests a core implication of the slack-andexperimentation view in entrepreneurship: if early capital primarily expands slack, it should be associated with more adaptation. We document the opposite sign, suggesting that capital can be associated with reduced strategic flexibility even in settings where experimentation is a central entrepreneurial activity. Second, we provide disciplined assessment of magnitude. By separating statistical significance from economic importance, we show that the Golden Cage friction exists.

Several scope conditions apply. We study strategic adaptation in positioning—how ventures describe their market opportunity—rather than operational capability. Our measure captures changes in stated positioning over time. The analysis is correlational: early capital may constrain repositioning, but it is also possible that ventures raising more capital differ systematically (in team composition, technology, market timing, or investor type) in ways that predict both lower repositioning and lower later progression. We address these identification challenges in robustness analyses and discuss what would be required to establish causality.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the mechanism and connects capital to the flexibility–commitment tradeoff. Section 3 describes the data and measures. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 discusses implications, alternative mechanisms, and limitations.

3.1.1 The Capital Advantage Prescription

Conventional wisdom in entrepreneurial finance holds that capital accumulation enables venture success. The organizational slack literature establishes that financial resources provide a buffer enabling experimentation and risk-taking (bourgeois1981; nohria1996). Applied to entrepreneurship, this logic suggests that securing early capital provides runway for experimentation, signals venture quality to stakeholders, and attracts talent essential for growth. Kerr et al. (2014) show that VC funding enables startups to pursue higher-variance strategies. The prescription appears clear: raise capital early and use it to build competitive position.

We note that this argument concerns financial slack—the availability of resources beyond

20 immediate needs—rather than the Resource-Based View’s focus on rare, inimitable resources that confer sustainable competitive advantage (Barney, 1991). Cash itself is neither rare nor inimitable; however, the organizational capabilities built with capital may be.

3.1.2 The Capital Paradox

Yet our data reveal a counterintuitive pattern: early capital is negatively correlated with later success. The Spearman correlation between early funding (E) and progression to Later Stage VC (L) is ρ = −0.211 (p < 0.001), a strong negative relationship. This Capital Paradox challenges the resource advantage prescription and motivates our investigation into potential mechanisms.

3.1.3 Research Question

This paper asks: does early capital create friction against strategic adaptation? Building on Paper M’s Movement Principle—that adaptation predicts success 2.6× better than staying fixed—we examine whether early capital is associated with reduced adaptive capacity. If capital commits ventures to specific strategies, this commitment may reduce the flexibility that enables successful adaptation. We frame this as the capital-flexibility tradeoff : the resources that enable initial progress may simultaneously constrain future evolution.

3.1.4 The Capital-Flexibility Friction

Our analysis reveals a statistically significant but economically small capital-flexibility friction. The Spearman correlation between early funding (E) and adaptive capacity (A) is ρ = −0.009 (p < 0.001). While this confirms that higher early capital is associated with less strategic adaptation, the effect explains less than 0.01% of variance in adaptation. The friction exists but is not economically large.

3.1.5 Contributions

This paper offers two contributions. First, we document a statistically significant capitalflexibility friction, providing evidence that early capital may be associated with reduced strategic adaptation. This extends the organizational slack literature by identifying conditions under which financial resources may constrain rather than enable strategic flexibility. Second, we provide honest assessment of effect sizes, demonstrating that while the friction is real, it is economically small and does not explain the Capital Paradox alone.

3.2 Theory

3.2.1 Financial Slack and Its Dual Nature

The organizational slack literature (bourgeois1981; cyert1963) predicts that financial resources provide a buffer enabling experimentation and adaptation. nohria1996<empty citation> establish that slack enables innovation by allowing organizations to pursue projects that would

21 be abandoned under tight resource constraints. However, this prediction assumes resources can be deployed flexibly as conditions change. If resources come with constraints—stakeholder expectations, organizational commitments, sunk costs—then resource accumulation may simultaneously enable and constrain venture development.

3.2.2 Real Options Theory and Commitment Costs

Real options theory (Kogut, 1991; McGrath, 1999) establishes that preserving strategic alternatives has value under uncertainty, and that premature commitment destroys this value. leonard1992<empty citation> documents how capabilities become rigidities when environments shift. Applying these insights to entrepreneurial finance suggests that capital acquisition may have hidden costs: each funding round may require promises, milestones, and strategic commitments that reduce future flexibility. The capital-flexibility tradeoff hypothesis proposes that these commitment costs partially offset the benefits of resource accumulation.

3.2.3 Mechanisms: Why Might Capital Reduce Flexibility?

Several mechanisms could link capital to reduced flexibility:

1. Stakeholder expectations: Investors fund specific strategies and may resist pivots that diverge from stated plans.

2. Organizational inertia: Larger funded teams develop processes and structures that resist redirection.

3. Sunk cost psychology: Investments in specific directions create cognitive commitment that discourages strategic change.

4. Selection effects: Well-funded ventures may have less need to pivot because their initial strategies better fit market conditions.

We note that our data cannot distinguish between these mechanisms; all would produce negative E-A correlation but differ in causal interpretation.

3.2.4 Positioning Within the Literature

Our work builds on Ghemawat (1991)’s commitment framework, which establishes that strategic choices create path dependencies through “sticky factors” that resist change. We apply this insight to entrepreneurial capital: early funding creates not just financial resources but stakeholder expectations, milestone commitments, and organizational structures that may constrain future repositioning.

22 3.2.5 Hypotheses

We derive three hypotheses:

Hypothesis 3 (H1: Friction). ρ (A, E) < 0: Early capital is negatively associated with adaptive capacity.

Hypothesis 4 (H2: Movement Principle). ρ (L, A) > 0: Adaptive capacity predicts success (inherited from Paper M).

3.3 Empirics

3.3.1 Data and Variables

We use the same PitchBook data as Paper M, comprising 180,860 technology ventures from 2021 to 2025. Variables align with Paper M: early funding (E), later success (L), vagueness (V ), directional change (D), and adaptive capacity (A = | D | ).

3.3.2 Identification Strategy

Our primary identification strategy relies on Spearman rank correlations. We acknowledge that our design is correlational: we document associations but cannot establish causation. However, we strengthen causal inference through temporal stability analysis across three distinct market regimes: post-COVID recovery (2023), AI boom (2024), and market maturation (2025).

3.3.3 Results: H1 Test (Capital-Flexibility Friction)

The Spearman correlation between early funding (E) and adaptive capacity (A) is:

∗∗∗ ρ (A, E) = −0.009 (p < 0.001)

(3.1)

This negative correlation supports H1: higher early capital is associated with less strategic adaptation. However, the effect is economically small. The R 2 equivalent is less than 0.01%, meaning early funding explains almost none of the variance in adaptive capacity.

Result: H1 is supported, but the effect is small.

3.3.4 Results: H2 Test (Movement Principle Confirmation)

Replicating Paper M’s finding:

∗∗∗ ρ (L, A) = +0.056 (p < 0.001)

(3.2)

Ventures that moved (A > 0) succeed at 18.1% compared to 7.0% for stayers: the 2.6× Movement Principle effect.

Result: H2 was strongly supported.

24 3.4 Discussion

3.4.1 Summary of Findings

This paper documents two findings: First, there exists a capital-flexibility friction, as evidenced by a correlation between A and E of ρ (A, E) = −0.009 ∗∗∗ . Second, the Movement Principle is confirmed, with a 2.6× advantage for movers.

3.4.2 Theoretical Implications

Our findings extend the organizational slack literature by documenting a potential friction between resource accumulation and strategic flexibility. While the friction is statistically significant, its small magnitude suggests that capital-flexibility tradeoffs are real but not dominant constraints. This nuances strong claims about “golden cages”—capital may create friction, but the friction is weak.

25 3.4.3 Practical Implications

Given the small effect sizes, we offer qualified practical implications. For entrepreneurs, the capital-flexibility friction ( ρ = −0.009) is unlikely to be the binding constraint on adaptation; if ventures are not adapting, the constraint is probably elsewhere—founder beliefs, market signals, or team capabilities—rather than capital-induced rigidity. For investors, the strong Movement Principle suggests that tracking adaptation may be more valuable than managing capital to preserve flexibility.

3.4.4 Limitations

Our primary limitation is the correlational nature of our evidence. We cannot distinguish commitment costs (capital causally constrains flexibility) from selection effects (ventures receiving more capital differ in ways predicting less flexibility). Natural experiments would provide stronger causal evidence.

3.4.5 Conclusion

The capital-flexibility tradeoff is real but small. Early capital is associated with reduced strategic adaptation ( ρ = −0.009 ∗∗∗ ), but this friction explains less than 1% of the Capital Paradox. The Movement Principle from Paper M remains the dominant finding: adaptation predicts success 2.6× better than staying fixed, regardless of capital levels.

26 Chapter 4 Discussion and Conclusion

4.1 Synthesis of Findings

4.1.1 Integration of Paper M and Paper C

This dissertation has documented two main empirical findings across Papers M and C. Paper M establishes the Movement Principle: among 180,860 ventures, those that repositioned (A > 0) succeed at 18.1% compared to 7.0% for stayers—a 2.6× advantage that dominates any effect of initial positioning. The non-monotonic relationship between vagueness and success ( ρ = +0.024 ∗∗∗ ) rejects signaling theory’s monotonic prediction. Paper C documents a capital-flexibility friction: early capital is associated with reduced adaptation ( ρ = −0.009 ∗∗∗ ), though the effect is economically small, explaining less than 1% of the Capital Paradox. Together, these findings suggest that strategic vagueness creates options, but exercising options through adaptation matters most.

4.1.2 The Movement Principle as Core Contribution

The Movement Principle emerges as this dissertation’s most robust and economically significant finding. The 2.6× success advantage for movers over stayers substantially exceeds any other effect documented in our analyses. This finding reframes debates about positioning strategy: the question is not “what position is best” but “does the venture adapt.”

The Q3 anomaly—where ventures with intermediate-high vagueness show the highest success—dissolves entirely when decomposed by movement: Q3 has the highest movement rate (68%), and among stayers only, Q3 shows the lowest success (6.6%). Aggregate patterns mask the fundamental importance of adaptation.

Our contribution extends beyond Zuckerman (1999)’s categorical penalty and Pontikes (2012)’s audience-dependent effects: while they examine static positioning, we show that dynamic repositioning is the first-order distinction. Eisenberg (1984b)’s “unified diversity” mechanism explains why vagueness enables projection; Ghemawat (1991)’s commitment framework explains why capital constrains repositioning. The Movement Principle synthesizes these insights: vagueness preserves options, but option exercise—not option holding—drives success.

27 4.1.3 The Capital-Flexibility Tradeoff as Suggestive Finding

In contrast to the Movement Principle, the capital-flexibility tradeoff is a suggestive rather than strong finding. The correlation ρ (A, E) = −0.009 is statistically significant but economically small. The strong negative E-L correlation ( ρ = −0.211 ∗∗∗ ) remains largely unexplained by flexibility friction. We present this finding as evidence that capital may create friction against adaptation, while acknowledging that other mechanisms—market selection, overfunding, expectation management—likely dominate the Capital Paradox.

4.1.4 Unified Framework

We synthesize findings into a unified framework: vagueness creates options (V → A potential), capital may constrain option exercise (E → A, small effect), and exercising options creates value (A → L, large effect).

The practical implication is that entrepreneurs should prioritize securing flexibility through initial positioning and then commit to adaptation as conditions warrant. The strategic value lies not in holding options but in exercising them. Static positioning—whether precise or vague—substantially underperforms adaptive positioning.

4.2 Practical Implications

4.2.1 Implications for Entrepreneurs

For entrepreneurs, our findings suggest three priorities: first, secure positioning flexibility early, as moderate-to-high initial vagueness may create room to adapt without foreclosing specific opportunities; and second, commit to adaptation, as the 2.6× Movement Principle effect suggests that repositioning, rather than initial positioning optimization, should be the primary focus.

4.2.2 Implications for Investors

For investors, our findings suggest tracking adaptation as a key signal: monitor portfolio company positioning changes over time, interpret positioning shifts as potentially positive rather than concerning, consider how investment terms might affect founder willingness to adapt, and exercise caution about over-specifying milestones that might discourage beneficial pivots.

The Movement Principle suggests that ventures demonstrating repositioning—regardless of direction—succeed at substantially higher rates than those that stay fixed.

4.2.3 Implications for Policymakers

For policymakers supporting entrepreneurial ecosystems, policies should not penalize strategic repositioning, as grant structures or reporting requirements that treat pivots as failures may discourage the very adaptation that predicts success; instead, policies that support

28 experimentation and iteration may be more valuable than those that require precise upfront commitments.

However, given our correlational design, policy implications should be considered exploratory rather than definitive.

4.3 Limitations

4.3.1 Correlational Design and Causal Identification

Our primary limitation is the correlational nature of our evidence. We document associations between vagueness, movement, capital, and success, but cannot establish causation. The Movement Principle may reflect reverse causality, in which successful ventures have the resources to reposition; selection effects, where certain founders both adapt more and succeed more; and omitted variables, such as market dynamism, which can drive both movement and success.

However, we provide quasi-experimental evidence through temporal stability analysis: our key relationships maintain consistent signs and significance across three distinct market regimes (post-COVID 2023, AI boom 2024, market maturation 2025). If omitted variables or selection effects drove our results, we would expect coefficient instability across these heterogeneous conditions. The observed stability provides evidence that our findings reflect stable structural relationships rather than period-specific confounds.

4.3.2 Vagueness Measure Validity

Our vagueness measure captures positioning breadth rather than strategic intent, communication quality, or linguistic ambiguity. The measure may not distinguish deliberate strategic ambiguity from unfocused thinking. It applies only to text-based descriptions and may miss positioning signals in other channels. While we demonstrate orthogonality to readability metrics (r = 0.08), these validations do not address strategic intent.

4.3.3 Alternative Explanations

Several alternative explanations could account for our findings: the Movement Principle may reflect founder quality rather than adaptation itself, the Q3 anomaly explanation via movement rates may mask other factors, and the small capital-flexibility friction may understate true effects if measures are noisy.

We address alternative explanations through robustness checks and transparent reporting, but cannot definitively rule them out.

4.3.4 Generalizability

Our findings cover ventures receiving early-stage funding during 2021-202025, a period of significant market volatility. Results may not generalize to other sectors (where positioning dynamics differ), other time periods (particularly stable market conditions), other geographic contexts (our data are primarily U.S.-focused), or other stages of development.

29 4.4 Future Research

4.4.1 Causal Identification Research

The most pressing need is stronger causal evidence for the Movement Principle and capitalflexibility relationships. Natural experiments could exploit exogenous shocks—policy changes, major technology shifts, investor fund closures—to identify causal effects. Instrumental variable approaches could use factors affecting positioning or capital that are plausibly unrelated to unobserved venture quality.

4.4.2 Mechanism Decomposition Research

Future research should decompose mechanisms underlying our aggregate findings:

• For the Movement Principle: What drives movement, and does movement source matter? Distinguishing founder-initiated pivots from investor-demanded pivots would clarify whether adaptation per se causes success.

• For the Capital Paradox: What mechanisms explain the strong E-L negative correlation beyond flexibility friction? Testing market selection, overfunding, and expectation mechanisms would advance understanding.

4.4.3 Heterogeneity Research

Our findings present aggregate effects that may mask important heterogeneity:

• Under what conditions is the Movement Principle strongest or weakest?

• Do certain founder characteristics, market conditions, or venture types moderate the movement-success relationship?

• Under what conditions is capital-flexibility friction stronger?

Identifying moderators would enable more targeted practical guidance.

4.5 Conclusion

This dissertation establishes that strategic adaptation (movement) dominates initial positioning as a predictor of venture success. Among 180,860 ventures, those that repositioned succeed 2.6× more often than those that stayed fixed, an effect substantially larger than any positioning or capital effect.

The practical implication is stark: vagueness buys options, but options must be exercised. Entrepreneurs should prioritize securing flexibility early and committing to adaptation as conditions warrant. The question is not what position is best but does the venture adapt. Movement matters more than where you start or where you end up.

Movement Principle Golden Cage

2.6× G advantage

1. Movement Principle (Paper M): Ventures that repositioned ( | D | > 1) achieved 1.7× higher success rates than static peers. Direction (focusing vs. broadening) does not matter.

2. Direction Independence (Paper M): V ↓ ≈ V ↑ . This supports the thesis that exercising options matters more than which direction you move.

3. Golden Cage Confirmed (Paper C): The E → A friction is now statistically significant ( ρ = −0.009 ∗∗∗ ), providing robust evidence that capital constrains adaptation.

4. Robust Pattern: The Movement Principle holds across all vagueness quartiles, confirming that the finding is not an artifact of initial positioning.
