# C1: Implications (Practitioners)

**¶105-108 | Target: Entrepreneurs (105-106), Investors (107-108) | 4¶**

**¶105** **The world you live in**: You already know something feels off. You raised capital to accelerate learning, but the more you raise, the harder it becomes to change course. Investors who once loved your vision now hold you accountable to it. Board meetings become performance theater. Internal doubts become unspeakable. You are not imagining this. The data confirms it: dG/dE < 0 in early-stage ventures. The very capital meant to enable experimentation can disable it.

**¶106** **A hypothesis worth testing**: Consider separating your internal compass from your external pitch. Internally, track whether you are moving (|ΔV| > 0) or stuck. Externally, frame your strategy as provisional: "We believe X, and here is how we will test it." This is not about hedging—it is about preserving movement capacity. Movers outperform stayers 1.8× not because movement is always right, but because staying is almost always wrong. This framing is itself a hypothesis. If investors reject provisional language, that rejection tells you something about the trap you might be entering.

**¶107** **For investors—a counterintuitive signal**: Your conviction alignment with the founder may be a risk factor, not a strength. When you and the founder share identical beliefs, belief variance collapses. The venture loses its capacity to learn from disagreement. Consider this: the ventures that survive are not the ones where everyone agreed from the start. They are the ones that could update. Seek co-investors who challenge your thesis. Their disagreement is not noise—it is insurance against the trap.

**¶108** **Funding movement, not positions**: Structure terms that permit pivoting. Replace milestone rigidity with learning milestones: "What did you learn?" rather than "Did you hit the target?" The 1.8× survival advantage for movers suggests that the best investment is not in the vision itself, but in the venture's capacity to revise it. You have deep tacit knowledge about what works. These findings offer one more input—a testable hypothesis about where the traps hide.
