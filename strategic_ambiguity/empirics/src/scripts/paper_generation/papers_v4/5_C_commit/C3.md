# C3: CODA (Commit to Movement)

**¶113** **Contributions.** This paper makes three contributions. *Layer 1 (What):* I introduce the Movement variable M = |ΔV| and establish two robust relationships—dG/dM > 0 (movers outperform 1.8×) and dM/dE < 0 (capital suppresses movement). *Layer 2 (How):* I decompose the Funding Paradox as dG/dE = (dG/dM)(dM/dE) < 0, explaining why well-funded ventures underperform through two distinct trap mechanisms—the High-V trap (too vague to learn) and the Low-V trap (too specific to pivot). *Layer 3 (Why):* I derive the Learning Trap condition μ(1−μ) < ε/V, showing how funding triggers belief variance collapse at both extremes. **Escape routes:** Movers (zoom in or zoom out) outperform stayers regardless of direction—the common factor is movement itself. **Boundary conditions:** These findings hold when initial vagueness V₀ > 30, funding E > $1M, and in contexts where uncertainty exceeds coordination benefits. **Prescription:** Commit to movement, not to the promises that fund it. 必死卽生, 必生卽死.
