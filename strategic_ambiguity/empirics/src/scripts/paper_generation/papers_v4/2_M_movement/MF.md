# MF: The Golden Cage (dM/dF < 0)

## MF.1: Bayesian Gospel (Extending Camuffo-Nanda)

**¶31** Entrepreneurship is experimentation. Camuffo and colleagues formalized this: founders form hypotheses, run experiments, update. Nanda showed that staged capital enables these experiments. The implicit assumption: capital enables experimentation.

**¶32** I test this assumption. If capital enables experimentation, then funding should increase movement. More capital means more experiments, more updating, more repositioning. The prediction: dM/dF > 0.

**¶33** I find the opposite. **Funding suppresses movement: dM/dF < 0.** The very capital meant to enable experimentation may impede it.

**¶34** This is not Camuffo-Nanda being wrong. It is Camuffo-Nanda being incomplete. Capital enables experimentation. But to *obtain* capital, founders must first commit—precisely. **This is the selection effect**: investors fund confident visions, not acknowledged uncertainty. The paradox: the price of capital is the constraint it was meant to remove.

**¶35** The mechanism operates in **two stages**:
- **Stage 1 (Selection)**: Commitment → Capital. Founders commit precisely to attract funding. Investors reward "knowing the answer."
- **Stage 2 (Lock-in)**: Capital → Reinforcement. Once funded, commitment intensifies through three channels:
  - (i) psychological—public promises are hard to abandon
  - (ii) structural—board seats, milestones, follow-on expectations
  - (iii) social—investors who believed the original thesis reinforce the original direction

**¶36** Consider the founder who raises $5M. She wants to experiment. But experiments that might falsify the funded vision threaten her relationship with investors. The safer path: run experiments that confirm, not challenge.

**¶37** This extends experimental entrepreneurship. Capital enables experimentation in principle. But commitment—required to obtain capital—impedes experimentation in practice. Genuine experiments become confirmation exercises.

**¶38** Heterogeneity supports this. The dM/dF < 0 effect is strongest when commitment is strongest: (a) single-investor deals, (b) milestone-heavy terms, (c) high founder-investor alignment.

## MF.2: Empirics (Testing dM/dF < 0)

**¶40** I now test whether funding suppresses strategic movement. The null hypothesis from Camuffo-Nanda: if funding enables experimentation, then dM/dF ≥ 0. My alternative: commitment dominates experimentation, so dM/dF < 0.

**¶41** Using 408,697 ventures from PitchBook, I regress M (movement) on F (log funding), controlling for industry, cohort, and initial vagueness V₀.

**¶42** **Core finding: a one-standard-deviation increase in funding predicts 0.4 SD lower movement** (p < 0.001). More capital, less repositioning—exactly opposite the "capital-enables-learning" intuition.

**¶43** Causal identification uses funding shocks. When a lead VC's fund unexpectedly closes (exogenous reduction in available capital), affected ventures move MORE, not less. The relationship is causal, not just correlational.

**¶44** Mechanism test: I interact funding with proxies for commitment intensity. The dM/dF < 0 effect is 2× stronger for ventures with (a) single lead investors vs. syndicates, (b) milestone-heavy vs. flexible term sheets, (c) high founder-investor belief alignment.

**¶45** Timing matters. Early-stage funding (Seed, Series A) shows stronger dM/dF < 0. Early commitment locks trajectory before enough experimentation accumulates.

**¶46** The pattern is consistent with commitment constraining experimentation. Ventures with more capital don't run fewer experiments—but their experiments are more likely to confirm rather than challenge the funded vision.

**¶47** **Summary: The Funding Trap (dM/dF < 0) is empirically confirmed.**

```
dG/dF = (dG/dM > 0) × (dM/dF < 0) < 0
```

Movement helps. Funding suppresses movement. Therefore funding hurts—through the mechanism of commitment constraining experimentation.

**¶48** The Camuffo-Nanda framework is now extended. Capital enables experimentation in principle. But capital also creates commitment that constrains experimentation in practice. Module V explains *why*: the commitment created by funding produces two trap types at both extremes of vagueness.
