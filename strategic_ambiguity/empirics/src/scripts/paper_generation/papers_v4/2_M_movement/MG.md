## MG.1: Strategy Gospel (Extending Van den Steen)

**¶12** Van den Steen (2017) formalizes why commitment creates strategic value: "Strategy is the smallest set of choices to optimally guide other choices." The more irreversible the choice, the more it coordinates downstream decisions. Ghemawat (1991) adds that commitment's value stems from its costliness—if reversal were cheap, competitors would simply wait and copy.

**¶13** This logic has profound implications. If commitment creates coordination value, repositioning destroys it. Movement signals either (a) the initial position was wrong, or (b) the founder lacks conviction. Either interpretation damages stakeholder coordination. Porter (1996) extends: "trade-offs create the need for choice and protect against repositioners."

**¶14** Van den Steen's framework assumes the committed position is correct. Under this assumption, commitment's coordination benefits outweigh its rigidity costs. But what if the assumption fails? In entrepreneurial contexts, uncertainty is high enough that the initial position is rarely optimal.

**¶15** I propose that Van den Steen's mechanism remains valid, but his scope condition does not hold in nascent ventures. Commitment creates coordination value—but only when the *object* of commitment is appropriate. In high-uncertainty environments, the object that merits commitment shifts from *static position* to *movement*.

**¶16** I define Movement as M = |ΔV|, the magnitude of change in strategic vagueness between two time points. A venture "moves" when it zooms in (reduces vagueness) or zooms out (increases vagueness) based on evidence.

**¶17** Movement is not random pivoting. It is disciplined repositioning—Bayesian updating of strategic position based on evidence. This distinction matters: random pivoting destroys coordination value (as Van den Steen predicts), but disciplined movement may preserve it by signaling *commitment to learning*.

**¶18** Three movement types emerge: stayers (M≈0), zoom-in (M>0, ΔV<0), and zoom-out (M>0, ΔV>0). Each represents a different *structure* of commitment.

**¶19** If dG/dM > 0, Van den Steen's framework extends rather than collapses. Commitment remains valuable, but *what* one commits to matters as much as *that* one commits.

**¶20** The empirical question is now precise: controlling for initial conditions, do ventures that move outperform those that stay?

## MG.2: Empirics (Testing dG/dM > 0)

**¶21** Van den Steen's framework generates a clear prediction: if commitment to position creates coordination value, stayers should outperform movers. I test this prediction using 408,697 ventures from PitchBook (2021-2025).

**¶22** Movement M is computed as |ΔV|, where V is strategic vagueness derived from company descriptions. Growth G is operationalized as reaching Later Stage VC (Series C/D+).

**¶23** **Core finding: movers outperform stayers 1.8×.** Ventures with M > 0 show 18.0% survival versus 9.9% for stayers.

**¶24** Regression confirms: a one-standard-deviation increase in M predicts 7.3 percentage points higher survival probability (p < 0.001).

**¶25** Direction matters. Zoom-in ventures (ΔV < 0) achieve 17.5% survival. Zoom-out ventures (ΔV > 0) achieve 18.4%. Both outperform stayers.

**¶26** The finding challenges Van den Steen's scope, not his mechanism. In entrepreneurial contexts, committing to *movement* dominates committing to *static position*.

**¶26a** Why extend Van den Steen rather than Porter? Porter addresses *where* to compete; Van den Steen addresses *why* commitment creates value. I extend the mechanism, not the content.

**¶27** Alternative explanations addressed with cohort fixed effects and propensity score matching. The movement premium persists.

**¶28** Perhaps movement proxies for learning? This is not an alternative—it is the mechanism.

**¶29** **The Movement Principle (dG/dM > 0) is established.** Module MF investigates why funding suppresses movement.
