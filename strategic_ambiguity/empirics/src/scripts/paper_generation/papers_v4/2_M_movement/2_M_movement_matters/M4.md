# M4: Bayesian Gospel (Extending Camuffo-Nanda)

**¶31-39 | Target: Camuffo, Nanda | 9¶**

**¶31** Entrepreneurship is experimentation. Camuffo and colleagues formalized this: founders form hypotheses, run experiments, update. Nanda showed that staged capital enables these experiments. The implicit assumption: capital enables experimentation.

**¶32** I test this assumption. If capital enables experimentation, then funding should increase movement. More capital means more experiments, more updating, more repositioning. The prediction: dM/dF > 0.

**¶33** I find the opposite. Funding suppresses movement: dM/dF < 0. The very capital meant to enable experimentation may impede it.

**¶34** This is not Camuffo-Nanda being wrong. It is Camuffo-Nanda being incomplete. Capital enables experimentation. But to *obtain* capital, founders must first commit—precisely. This is the selection effect: investors fund confident visions, not acknowledged uncertainty. The paradox: the price of capital is the constraint it was meant to remove.

**¶35** The mechanism operates in two stages. **Stage 1 (Selection)**: Commitment → Capital. Founders commit precisely to attract funding. Investors reward "knowing the answer." **Stage 2 (Lock-in)**: Capital → Reinforcement. Once funded, commitment intensifies through three channels: (i) psychological—public promises are hard to abandon; (ii) structural—board seats, milestones, follow-on expectations; (iii) social—investors who believed the original thesis reinforce the original direction.

**¶36** Consider the founder who raises $5M. She wants to experiment. But experiments that might falsify the funded vision threaten her relationship with investors who committed to that vision. The safer path: run experiments that confirm, not challenge.

**¶37** This extends experimental entrepreneurship. Capital enables experimentation in principle. But commitment—required to obtain capital—impedes experimentation in practice. Genuine experiments become confirmation exercises.

**¶38** Heterogeneity supports this. The dM/dF < 0 effect is strongest when commitment is strongest: (a) single-investor deals, (b) milestone-heavy terms, (c) high founder-investor alignment.

**¶39** Module M5 tests the core claim: dM/dF < 0. If funding suppresses movement, the commitment mechanism is confirmed.
