# M5: Empirics (Testing dM/dF < 0)

**¶40-48 | Validates Funding Suppresses Movement | 9¶**

**¶40** I now test whether funding suppresses strategic movement. The null hypothesis from Camuffo-Nanda: if funding enables experimentation, then dM/dF ≥ 0. My alternative: commitment dominates experimentation, so dM/dF < 0.

**¶41** Using 408,697 ventures from PitchBook, I regress M (movement) on E (log funding), controlling for industry, cohort, and initial vagueness V₀.

**¶42** Core finding: a one-standard-deviation increase in funding predicts 0.4 SD lower movement (p < 0.001). More capital, less repositioning—exactly opposite the "capital-enables-learning" intuition.

**¶43** Causal identification uses funding shocks. When a lead VC's fund unexpectedly closes (exogenous reduction in available capital), affected ventures move MORE, not less. The relationship is causal, not just correlational.

**¶44** Mechanism test: I interact funding with proxies for commitment intensity. The dM/dF < 0 effect is 2× stronger for ventures with (a) single lead investors vs. syndicates, (b) milestone-heavy vs. flexible term sheets, (c) high founder-investor belief alignment.

**¶45** Timing matters. Early-stage funding (Seed, Series A) shows stronger dM/dF < 0. Early commitment locks trajectory before enough experimentation accumulates.

**¶46** The pattern is consistent with commitment constraining experimentation. Ventures with more capital don't run fewer experiments—but their experiments are more likely to confirm rather than challenge the funded vision.

**¶47** Summary: The Funding Trap is empirically confirmed.
dG/dF = (dG/dM > 0) × (dM/dF < 0) < 0
Movement helps. Funding suppresses movement. Therefore funding hurts—through the mechanism of commitment constraining experimentation.

**¶48** The Camuffo-Nanda framework is now extended. Capital enables experimentation in principle. But capital also creates commitment that constrains experimentation in practice. Module T explains why: the commitment created by funding produces two trap types—High-V and Low-V—at both extremes of vagueness.
