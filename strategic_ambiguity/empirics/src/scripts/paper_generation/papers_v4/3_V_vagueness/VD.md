# VD: Vagueness → Direction (dD/dV)

**¶73-80 | "Why" — How Vagueness affects Direction | Zoom-in vs Zoom-out Analysis**

## Synthesis: Both Extremes Trap

**¶73** Both extremes trap ventures:
- **Too vague (high-V)**: hypotheses are unfalsifiable, learning cannot identify what to reject
- **Too specific (low-V)**: commitment locks in direction, pivoting betrays believers

The stayer pattern (M≈0) emerges from both mechanisms.

**¶74** The unified trap equation: **μ(1−μ) < ε/V** captures both failures:
- High-V traps fail on the right side—no clear prediction to test
- Low-V traps fail on the left side—belief variance collapses to zero

**¶75** Funding accelerates both traps:
- High-V ventures attract "vision" investors who reward staying vague
- Low-V ventures attract "execution" investors who punish pivoting

Capital selects for the investors who will cage you.

**¶76** This completes the dM/dF < 0 mechanism. Funding doesn't directly suppress movement—it **selects for stakeholders whose incentives resist movement**. The trap is structural, not intentional.

## Direction Patterns

**¶77** Data shows the pattern across industries:

| Industry | V Level | Stayer Ratio | Survival |
|:---------|:--------|:-------------|:---------|
| Mobility | High-V (V₀=78) | 91% | 5% |
| Biotech (subset) | Low-V | High milestone | Low pivot success |

Both extremes underperform movers.

**¶78** The stayer archetype (M≈0) has two origins:
- Some stayers are trapped at **high-V**—unable to zoom in
- Others are trapped at **low-V**—unable to zoom out

Same outcome, different mechanisms.

## Direction-Based Escape Routes

**¶79** Escape requires different prescriptions based on direction:

| Trap Type | Direction Needed | Prescription |
|:----------|:-----------------|:-------------|
| **High-V** | Zoom In (ΔV < 0) | Force specificity before funding—testable hypotheses that can fail |
| **Low-V** | Zoom Out (ΔV > 0) | Force diversity—doubters who preserve belief variance |

**¶80** The funding paradox is now explained:

```
dG/dF < 0 because (dG/dM > 0) × (dM/dF < 0)
```

Movement predicts growth; funding suppresses movement through the **twin traps of flexibility and commitment**.

## The D Variable

Direction D = sign(ΔV) determines escape strategy:

| D | Meaning | Movement Type | Example |
|:--|:--------|:--------------|:--------|
| D < 0 | Zooming In | Increasing precision | "Autonomy platform" → "L4 robotaxi in SF" |
| D > 0 | Zooming Out | Increasing scope | "Robotaxi only" → "Full-stack AV provider" |
| D = 0 | Staying | No direction change | Trapped (stayer) |

### Key Insight

M = |ΔV| tells you *how much* you moved
D = sign(ΔV) tells you *which direction* you moved

Both matter for survival:
- Zoom-in (D < 0): 17.5% survival
- Zoom-out (D > 0): 18.4% survival
- Stay (D = 0): 9.9% survival

## Handoff to E Module

Module E examines escape routes:
- How did Aurora (zoom out) escape with high funding?
- How did Motional (stay at low-V) get trapped?
- The prescription: **Platformize → Acculturate → Evaluate**
