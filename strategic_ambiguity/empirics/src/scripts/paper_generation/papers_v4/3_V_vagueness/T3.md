# T3: Low-V Trap (Commitment Trap)

**¶65-72 | Too Specific → Hard to Pivot | 8¶**

---

**¶65** **Low-V trap mechanism: 몰입 고착 → pivot 불능.** When ventures commit too specifically, their precise promises attract believers who expect exactly that outcome. Pivoting means betraying the very people who funded you.

**¶66** The mechanism operates in two stages. **Stage 1 (Selection)**: Commitment attracts capital. Founders who articulate precise visions attract investors who believe that exact thesis. Due diligence rewards "knowing the answer." Doubt gets filtered out before the check clears. **Stage 2 (Lock-in)**: Capital reinforces commitment. Staw's (1976) escalation research explains why—decision-makers "become locked into a course of action" when personally responsible for initial investment. Founders who raised on specific promises find reversal costly to identity, not just strategy.

**¶67** The echo chamber forms through both stages. Selection filters for believers. Lock-in silences doubters. The result: homogeneous stakeholders who share the founder's exact thesis—and whose agreement makes learning impossible.

**¶68** The learning condition applies: **μ(1−μ) < ε/V**. Low V raises the threshold—but the real problem is belief homogenization. When everyone agrees, variance μ(1−μ) approaches zero. No amount of evidence can update a unanimous prior.

**¶69** Data confirms the pattern. Ventures with more precise initial positioning show higher investor-founder alignment but lower survival when market conditions shift. They hit their specific targets but missed the actual opportunity.

**¶70** Examples illustrate. Biotech ventures locked into specific indications. Deep tech ventures committed to particular applications. Each attracted funding for precision—then couldn't adapt when evidence suggested pivoting.

**¶71** The trap is particularly dangerous because it looks like success. Hitting milestones feels like progress. Investor enthusiasm feels like validation. The venture is winning its defined game while losing the real one.

**¶72** Escape requires belief diversity before funding. Add a doubter—an investor or advisor who challenges the specific thesis. Their disagreement preserves the variance needed for learning when evidence demands change.
