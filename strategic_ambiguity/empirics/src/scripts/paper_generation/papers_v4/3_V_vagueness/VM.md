# VM: Vagueness → Movement (dM/dV)

**¶49-72 | "Why" — How Vagueness affects Movement | Target: Stern, GKSS**

## The Learning Trap Condition

**¶49** The Funding Trap (dM/dF < 0) operates through two mechanisms. Both explain why capital, intended to enable learning, instead suppresses the movement that learning would produce.

**¶50** I frame traps as process failures, not outcome failures. A trap is a state where **learning halts**—where new evidence no longer updates beliefs or actions. The venture is stuck.

**¶51** Traps occur at both extremes of vagueness:
- **High-V traps**: the venture stays too vague, unable to zoom in despite needing focus
- **Low-V traps**: the venture stays too specific, unable to zoom out despite needing flexibility

**¶52** The learning condition formalizes this:

```
μ(1−μ) < ε/V
```

Here ε is the learning threshold (how much evidence is needed to update), and V is vagueness (inversely related to precision τ). When belief variance μ(1−μ) falls below ε/V, updating stops. The venture is trapped.

**¶53** Funding accelerates trap formation through two pathways: flexibility traps for high-V ventures and commitment traps for low-V ventures.

**¶54** Each mechanism has distinct signature:
- High-V traps: unfalsifiable hypotheses, vision alignment without movement
- Low-V traps: belief homogenization, milestone achievement without adaptation

## High-V Trap (Flexibility Paradox)

**¶57** **High-V trap mechanism: 옵션 유지 → 학습 불능.** When ventures stay too vague, they preserve optionality but cannot learn. Their hypotheses cannot be rejected—there's nothing specific enough to test against evidence.

**¶58** The learning condition: **μ(1−μ) < ε/V**. High V lowers the threshold—but the real problem is that without specificity, founders cannot identify *what* to reject. Learning requires surprise, and surprise requires prediction.

**¶59** High-V founders attract believers who share their grand vision. These investors "get it" precisely because there's nothing concrete to disagree about. Agreement is easy when definitions are loose.

**¶60** The flexibility trap paradox: vagueness preserves options but prevents learning. The venture can go anywhere—but has no signal about where to go. **Mobility ventures exemplify this: V₀=78, 91% stayer ratio, 5% survival.**

**¶61** The mechanism has two components:
- Internal: founders cannot design discriminating tests
- External: stakeholders cannot hold founders accountable to specific predictions

**¶62** Data shows the pattern. High-V ventures show more "vision alignment" with investors but less movement over time.

**¶63** High-V ventures need to zoom in. But investors reward vagueness. The flexibility that attracted capital becomes the cage.

**¶64** **Escape requires forcing specificity before funding.** Convert vague promises into testable hypotheses that can fail.

## Low-V Trap (Commitment Paradox)

**¶65** **Low-V trap mechanism: 몰입 고착 → pivot 불능.** When ventures commit too specifically, their precise promises attract believers who expect exactly that outcome. Pivoting means betraying the very people who funded you.

**¶66** The mechanism operates in **two stages**:
- **Stage 1 (Selection)**: Commitment attracts capital. Founders who articulate precise visions attract investors who believe that exact thesis. Due diligence rewards "knowing the answer." Doubt gets filtered out before the check clears.
- **Stage 2 (Lock-in)**: Capital reinforces commitment. Staw's (1976) escalation research explains why—decision-makers "become locked into a course of action" when personally responsible for initial investment.

**¶67** The **echo chamber** forms through both stages. Selection filters for believers. Lock-in silences doubters. The result: homogeneous stakeholders who share the founder's exact thesis—and whose agreement makes learning impossible.

**¶68** The learning condition applies: **μ(1−μ) < ε/V**. Low V raises the threshold—but the real problem is belief homogenization. When everyone agrees, variance μ(1−μ) approaches zero. No amount of evidence can update a unanimous prior.

**¶69** Data confirms the pattern. Ventures with more precise initial positioning show higher investor-founder alignment but lower survival when market conditions shift.

**¶70** Examples: Biotech ventures locked into specific indications. Deep tech ventures committed to particular applications. Each attracted funding for precision—then couldn't adapt.

**¶71** The trap is particularly dangerous because **it looks like success**. Hitting milestones feels like progress. Investor enthusiasm feels like validation. The venture is winning its defined game while losing the real one.

**¶72** **Escape requires belief diversity before funding.** Add a doubter—an investor or advisor who challenges the specific thesis. Their disagreement preserves the variance needed for learning.
