# T2: High-V Trap (Flexibility Trap)

**¶57-64 | Too Vague → Hard to Reject/Learn | 8¶**

---

**¶57** **High-V trap mechanism: 옵션 유지 → 학습 불능.** When ventures stay too vague, they preserve optionality but cannot learn. Their hypotheses cannot be rejected—there's nothing specific enough to test against evidence.

**¶58** The learning condition formalizes this: **μ(1−μ) < ε/V**. High V lowers the threshold—but the real problem is that without specificity, founders cannot identify *what* to reject. Learning requires surprise, and surprise requires prediction. Options without learning are not strategic—they are paralysis.

**¶59** High-V founders attract believers who share their grand vision. These investors "get it" precisely because there's nothing concrete to disagree about. Agreement is easy when definitions are loose.

**¶60** The flexibility trap paradox: vagueness preserves options but prevents learning. The venture can go anywhere—but has no signal about where to go. Mobility ventures exemplify this: V₀=78, 91% stayer ratio, 5% survival.

**¶61** The mechanism has two components. Internal: founders cannot design discriminating tests. External: stakeholders cannot hold founders accountable to specific predictions that would reveal failure.

**¶62** Data shows the pattern. High-V ventures show more "vision alignment" with investors but less movement over time. Their beliefs update less because there's nothing specific enough to contradict.

**¶63** High-V ventures need to zoom in. But investors reward vagueness. The flexibility that attracted capital becomes the cage.

**¶64** Escape requires forcing specificity before funding. The most successful high-V ventures deliberately constrain their vision *before* raising—converting vague promises into testable hypotheses that can fail.
