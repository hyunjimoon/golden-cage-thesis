## Content (CARE: Crisp limitations, Earned vision)

Three limitations and corresponding future directions:

---

## Three Limitations

| # | Limitation | Implication |
|:-:|:-----------|:------------|
| 1 | **Correlation, not causation** | Funding may reflect unobserved characteristics |
| 2 | **Sample bias** | PitchBook overrepresents tech/U.S.—generalization requires replication |
| 3 | **Mechanism inference** | Golden cage mechanism awaits direct measurement of governance beliefs |

---

## Future Work

| Direction | Method | Expected Contribution |
|:----------|:-------|:----------------------|
| **Causal identification** | Natural experiments (exogenous funding shocks) | Isolate causal effect |
| **Mechanism validation** | Board belief diversity measurement (survey, text analysis) | Direct evidence |
| **Simulation** | Replicate observed phenomena computationally | Show causality |
| **Alternative metrics** | Test with web traffic, employees | Boundary conditions |

## Vision: 1인 1창업 시대 (Era of One Person, One Startup)

**Ultimate goal**: Build a mentoring vehicle that captures the dynamics between resource, perception, and action of an agent—bringing forth the era of autonomy.

The ultimate validation: if these tools work for producing a PhD thesis, they work for producing a venture.

> **Mentoring vehicle**: One venture per person, using AI agents for collaboration, platforms for delivery, and planned pivots for learning.

## One-Sentence Summary

> **"Commitment attracts believers; believers provide funding; funding solidifies the echo chamber; echo chambers block learning."**

---

## Closing

The golden cage warns against premature commitment. This thesis demonstrates the alternative: **commit to *process*, pivot through *learning*, scale through *tools*.**

Future work should pursue natural experiments for causal identification, simulation for counterfactual analysis, and longitudinal governance studies for direct mechanism evidence.

*必死卽生, 必生卽死*
*Commit to die, and you shall live.*
