## Content (CARE: Earned conclusions)

**Core Message**: Commit to *reposition*, not position.

> Position이 아닌 reposition에 commit하라.
> Mover는 변화하는 환경에 적응해 끊임없이 repositioning하는 자다.

## For Founders

- Commit to *reposition*, not position
- Commit to *direction*, not destination
- Design governance that *preserves* skeptical voices—before funding *eliminates* them
- Prioritize **Platformization** and **Collaboration** over **Processification** and **Automation** until market signals clarify
- Use **Strategic Ambiguity** as capitalization tool

---

## For Investors

- Because successful ventures often *reposition* away from initial pitch, governance should *anticipate* pivoting, not *monitor* for plan adherence
- Distinguish between **Acculturation** alignment (valuable for cohesion) and **Operational** commitment (potentially premature)
- Fund platform capability, not product specificity

---

## For Scholars

- Because governance *constrains* adaptation (structural), not incentives (moral hazard), intervention should target governance design, not founder monitoring
- The cage is operational, not motivational
- Self-selection mechanism grounds this in econometric theory
- Object of commitment must shift from position to process in nascent environments
