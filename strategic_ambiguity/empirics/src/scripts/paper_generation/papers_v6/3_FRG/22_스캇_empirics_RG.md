## Content

The positive correlation between repositioning magnitude and growth outcomes.

Ventures in the upper-right quadrant (high R, high G) systematically outperform those in the lower-left (low R, low G). The relationship is approximately linear within the observed range, though with heteroskedasticity at high repositioning values.
