## Content

**Flexibility (F)** defined as the capacity to change strategic direction without prohibitive cost.

| Dimension | High Flexibility | Low Flexibility |
|:----------|:-----------------|:----------------|
| Commitment level | Vision | Operations |
| Investor type | Strategic | Institutional VC |
| Governance | Diverse voices | Homogeneous |
| Architecture | Platform-based | Product-specific |

---

## Operationalization

Flexibility measured through:
1. Commitment object (Vision vs Operations)
2. Board diversity (heterogeneity of investor beliefs)
3. Architecture modularity (platform vs integrated)

---

## Key Insight

Flexibility is not the absence of commitment—it's commitment at the right level (direction, not destination).
