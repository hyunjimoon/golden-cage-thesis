## Boundary Conditions

The mover advantage likely varies with environmental conditions:
- In stable, well-understood markets → commitment benefits may dominate
- In nascent markets with uncertainty → repositioning advantage documented here

**Theoretical prediction**: The commitment orthodoxy (Porter, Ghemawat) should apply when uncertainty is low.
