## Content

The mover advantage reflects partial commitment (McGrath, 1999; Zuzul & Tripsas, 2020):

- Commit to *direction*, not destination
- Direction *enables* flexibility
- Flexibility *enables* learning
- Learning *enables* growth

## Operational Meaning (Fine's Framework)

Partial commitment = **Platformization** priority.

Commit to platform capability (common infrastructure deployable across segments) while deferring segment-specific capability development.

This is what "direction commitment" means operationally: investing in foundations that multiple strategies can leverage.
