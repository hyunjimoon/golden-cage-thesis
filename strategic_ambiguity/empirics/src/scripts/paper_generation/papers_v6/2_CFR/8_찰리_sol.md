## Content

Because funding *requires* specific *operational* commitment:

1. **Operational Commitment → Believers**: Specific operational commitments (production architecture, go-to-market sequence) *attract* investors expecting those milestones.

2. **Believers → No Skeptics**: Investors who believe in the specific operational approach *filter out* skeptics who see alternative paths.

3. **No Skeptics → Homogeneity**: The resulting board *exhibits* belief convergence.

4. **Homogeneity → No Signals**: Without skeptics, disconfirming signals *lack* advocates.

5. **No Signals → No Learning**: The venture *loses* capacity to reframe.

## Mechanism Chain

```
Operational Commitment (specific promises)
    ↓ attracts
Believers (skeptics decline)
    ↓ provide
Funding (believers invest)
    ↓ solidifies
Echo Chamber (everyone agrees)
    ↓ eliminates
Signal Diversity (no one says "pivot")
    ↓ blocks
Learning → GOLDEN CAGE
```

## Key Distinction

The cage is not about vision clarity—it's about **operational lock-in before market validation**.

- Vague *vision* + strong *acculturation* → can secure funding (Tesla)
- Vague *operations* → cannot secure funding
- Specific *operations* → attracts believers → cage
