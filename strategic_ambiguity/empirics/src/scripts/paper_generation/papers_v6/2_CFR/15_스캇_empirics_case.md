## Case 1: Segway

Segway raised $100M+ committed to a **specific production architecture**: gyroscopic two-wheel platform as THE solution for personal transportation.

**The cage formed because**:
- **Operational lock-in**: $100M invested in gyroscopic manufacturing, proprietary battery systems
- **Governance homogeneity**: Celebrity investors (Jeff Bezos, John Doerr) all believed in the specific two-wheel form factor
- **Signal blindness**: When market feedback indicated warehouse logistics as viable application, no governance voice *advocated* pivoting

The pivot to warehouse logistics (Segway Robotics) occurred only after near-failure.

## Case 2: Theranos (Holmes)

"One drop of blood" promise was very precise, exciting investors because of its specificity. But this precision created cognitive constraint—no room for pivoting when the technology didn't work.

---

## Case 3: Nikola

Specific promise of hydrogen trucking attracted believers. When evidence suggested alternative approaches, the governance structure lacked skeptical voices.

## Pattern

| Case | Specific Promise | Believers | Outcome |
|:-----|:-----------------|:----------|:--------|
| Segway | Gyroscopic platform | Celebrity VCs | Near-failure |
| Theranos | One drop diagnosis | Healthcare VCs | Fraud conviction |
| Nikola | Hydrogen trucks | ESG investors | Scandal |

## Key Insight

There is benefit in sharing the roadmap, but you don't want it to be too precise—it doesn't give room for pivoting.
