## Content

Funding requires commitment, and commitment attracts believers:

**Investor heterogeneity matters**:
- Institutional VCs → emphasize evaluation metrics, expect operational commitment
- Strategic investors → emphasize acculturation alignment, more tolerant of strategic pivots

---

## Self-Selection Mechanism

```
Specific Commitment → Believers JOIN, Skeptics PASS
→ Homogeneous Governance → Cage
```

**Econometric context**: One of 5 endogeneity sources
(omitted vars, measurement error, lagged DV, simultaneity, self-selection)

---

## Key Insight

The selection mechanism explains why well-funded ventures show less repositioning:
- It's not that funding *causes* rigidity
- It's that specific commitment *attracts* believers who *provide* funding and *expect* adherence
