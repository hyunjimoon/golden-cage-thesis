# 📜Pivoting Isn’t Enough? Managing Strategic Reorientation in New Ventures

## Introduction

  

In 1998, a team of entrepreneurs formed a startup, Conﬁnity, to enable business executives to securely access their companies’ information-technology systems on PalmPilot’s personal digital assistant. When corporate customers showed little interest, Conﬁnity offered an electronic wallet to store passwords and credit card numbers. Customers shrugged a second time, and the company reoriented again—this time focusing on software to “beam” money from one PalmPilot to another. Technophiles downloaded the new software in droves, but there were too few of them to support a company. Conﬁnity changed course yet again, this time creating a web version that enabled customers to send money via email. The site exploded in popularity, quickly attracting over 1 million users. Ultimately, it became PayPal (Furr and Dyer 2014).

  

PayPal’s circuitous innovation path is hardly unique. According to a growing body of research, new ventures that change strategic direction—even multiple times—can beneﬁt by conserving resources (Baker and Nelson 2005); discovering more effective ways to compete (Gavetti and Rivkin 2007); and reducing uncertainty about business models (McDonald and Eisenhardt 2019), commercialization partners

  

(Marx et al. 2014), new technologies (Furr et al. 2012), and their industry contexts (Hiatt and Sine 2014, Ozcan and Santos 2015). Changing strategy may even improve a venture’s prospects. In a sample of 400 startups, 93% of the success cases had had to abandon an original strategy that proved unviable (Bhide 2000). Conceptually, researchers and practitioners have compared strategic reorientations, or pivots, to the scientiﬁc process (Eisenmann et al. 2013): ventures pinpoint a customer problem to solve, test hypotheses about potential product solutions (Murray and Tripsas 2004), learn from market feedback (Bingham and Eisenhardt 2011), and determine whether and how to revise the product for a new target segment (Zott and Amit 2008).

  

Prescriptive methodologies that encourage purposeful strategy change have become virtually standard practices among technology ventures 1 (Ries 2011, Blank 2013), but unresolved issues persist. One issue is that strategic reorientations may represent such drastic shifts that the reformulated offering bears almost no resemblance to the original. O’Reilly and Tushman (2008) identiﬁed several examples of strategic shifts that were signiﬁcant enough to land ﬁrms in entirely different industries. More recently, Twitter began as a podcastdirectory, Flickr began as a role-playing game, and YouTube began as a dating site. Such success cases notwithstanding, many ventures stumble badly when altering strategy and are abandoned by crucial stakeholders (Kim 2016). We, therefore, consider it important to broaden the scope of inquiry beyond strategic reorientations prompted by market feedback to the larger context of ventures’ interactions with multiple audiences during these transitions.

  

Another unresolved issue stems from a special type of adaptation conundrum. New ventures must be perceived as legitimate to win funding from investors and attract attention from customers and the media (Aldrich and Fiol 1994). Lacking a performance history and a business precedent, these ventures are neither comprehensible nor meaningful to outsiders (a necessary condition for legitimacy) (Fisher et al. 2016). Entrepreneurs seek to get around this by using cultural tools (e.g., resonant stories, claims, and identities) to convince reluctant resource providers of the important problem that they will solve and the likelihood of being successful (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001, Zott and Huy 2007). Such claims, however, have the potential to complicate subsequent course corrections, especially if the new strategy takes the venture far away from its raison d’ˆetre. Given the penalty for deviating from audience expectations (Zuckerman 1999), abandoning the very concepts used to garner initial support risks alienating those who found the venture compelling.

  

Existing theories are, however, largely silent about how ventures justify reorientations to relevant constituencies and tend to ignore the larger interplay between strategic reorientation and organizational communication. Recent work on strategic renewal in established ﬁrms suggests that executives can inﬂuence audiences’ interpretation of change (Sonenshein and Dholakia 2012, Vaara et al. 2016, Dalpiaz and Di Stefano 2018) using rhetoric and narrative practices to gain affected parties’ endorsement for a new path (Dunford and Jones 2000, Sonenshein 2010). Such insights may have relevance for new ventures reorienting under more compressed timelines.

  

This paper aims to generate a more thorough understanding of the strategic reorientation process in new ventures. We focus on how ventures communicate redirections in strategy to audiences whose support they had previously elicited for an earlier concept. Such audiences are apt to view consistent organizations as more comprehensible and thus, legitimate (Aldrich and Fiol 1994), but consistency is at odds with the circuitous innovation paths that ventures follow (Brown and Eisenhardt 1997, Rindova and Kotha 2001, Ries 2011). We build on research in cultural entrepreneurship, which portrays audiences

  

as susceptible to symbolic inﬂuences (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001, Santos and Eisenhardt 2009, Kim and Jensen 2011, Dalpiaz et al. 2016). Compelling, coherent communication imbues ventures’ actions with meaning (Anthony et al. 2016), positively inﬂuencing the various constituencies—the media, investors, customers, and employees—that provide resources as they grow (Martens et al. 2007, Petkova et al. 2013, Wry et al. 2014).

  

To study these issues, we conducted a qualitative, longitudinal ﬁeld study of two pioneering automated investment-advisors—a nascent ﬁnancial technology with the potential to displace traditional human ﬁnancial advisors via an automated, software-based service. Using a comparative case inductive design (Eisenhardt and Graebner 2007, Battilana and Dorado 2010, Gurses and Ozcan 2015), we tracked the ventures forsixyearsbeginningatinceptionbeforetheyfunctioned as automated-advisors. Both ventures abandoned their original plans and initiated a series of strategic reorientations,resultingin reformulatedproductsandrevised target markets, and both evolved toward automated investment advisory offerings for retail investors. Despite the apparent similarities, the companies’ approaches to managing audiences during strategy transitions diverged conspicuously, and we develop new theory centered on and inspired by these differences.

  

Our study makes its contribution at the nexus of strategy, entrepreneurship, and organization theory. As our primary contribution, we develop a process model outlining a sequence of stratagems that enable ventures to fundamentally alter strategy while portraying themselves as faithful to enduring aims. Our theoretical framework posits that entrepreneursthrough careful management of audience expectations during strategy transitions—may be able to elicit support and engagement from customers, investors, and the media after reorienting. In a departure from prevailing notions of purposeful strategy change that assume unconstrained adaptation in new ventures, our model highlights reorientation without penalty as an underappreciated and complementary effort, which involves anticipating and justifying strategy transitions and staging them for various audiences. Like scientists, entrepreneurs generate and test hypotheses to solve problems and ﬁnd viable product solutions, but some may also become adept communicatorsskillfully conveying deviations from the plan to diverse constituencies on whose resources they continue to draw. By examining the insights and boundary conditions of our process model, we also pursue the theoretical and practical implications for research on organizational adaptation, cultural entrepreneurship, and the rhetoric of strategic change.

  

## Theoretical Background

  

Our study conceptualizes new ventures as pioneers in nascent markets—that is, as novel economic domains characterized by amorphous customers and products (Benner and Tripsas 2012, Ozcan and Santos 2015), uncertain new technologies (Anderson and Tushman 1990, Adner and Kapoor 2016), and extreme ambiguity about opportunities and risks (Santos and Eisenhardt 2009, Hiatt and Park 2013). A venture facing that level of uncertainty rarely has an optimal strategy at the outset (Bhide 2000, Furr 2019) but may ﬁnd a better one as the market matures (Gavetti and Rivkin 2007, McDonald and Eisenhardt 2019). Early assumptions often turn out to be wrong, providing the stimuli for change: in the words of one pair of scholars, “New ventures inevitably experience deviations—often huge ones—from their original planned targets. . . . [They] frequently require fundamental redirection” (McGrath and MacMillan 1995, pp. 2–3).

  

Research offers several perspectives that are capable of guiding ventures’ redirections in strategy. One strand draws on theories of adaptive learning to examine organizational processes that promote ﬂexibility and aid discovery. For instance, processes that entail experimenting (Thomke 2003), probing (Brown and Eisenhardt 1997), improvising (Miner et al. 2001, Davis et al. 2009), continuous morphing (Rindova and Kotha 2001), and incremental planning (Hiatt and Sine 2014) may enable resource-constrained ventures to adapt to novel and unstable domains. Acting on new information unearthed by these processes (Kerr et al. 2014), ventures initiate course corrections to improve on their previous position in the market (Marx and Hsu 2015, Grimes 2018). Such pivots resemble the scientiﬁc method: ventures identify a customer problem to solve (Alvarez et al. 2013), formulate and test hypotheses about possible solutions (Eisenmann et al. 2013), receive feedback from the market (usually from customers), and decide whether and how to alter the product to suit a new target segment (Zott and Amit 2008).

  

A separate stream of research, with roots in cultural entrepreneurship, explores how ventures build legitimacy to attract the resources that they need to operate. New ventures, which suffer from a “liability of newness,” are often ignored (Stinchcombe 1965, p. 148; Aldrich and Fiol 1994). To convince skeptical audiences of their appropriateness and viability (despite a lack of operating history), ventures use culture as a “toolkit” (Swidler 1986)—by borrowing resonant cultural symbols and themes (Kellogg 2011, Weber and Dacin 2011). For example, they may disseminate culturally resonant stories (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001, Weber et al. 2008, Santos and Eisenhardt 2009); emphasize such symbolic accomplishments

  

as endorsements, awards, and founder credentials (Rao 1994, Zott and Huy 2007, Hallen and Eisenhardt 2012); and construct distinctive identities (Wry et al. 2011, Zuzul and Tripsas 2019). Such claims serve as “a touchstone upon which legitimacy may be conferred by investors, competitors, and consumers, opening up access to new capital and market opportunities” (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001, p. 545; Harmon et al. 2015). Audiences that buy into them will in turn reward ventures with preferential resources (Wry et al. 2014) and attention ﬂows (Petkova et al. 2013).

  

Jointly, these diverse research streams are insightful but incomplete. If ventures are to reorient strategically, they must remain ﬂexible enough to respond ﬂuidly to altered circumstances. Yet, it remains unclear whether they are unencumbered enough to chart a radically new course or deal with constituencies that oppose the revised strategy. Ventures must also attract resources while iterating strategies. However, it remains a mystery how audiences come to view ventures with paths that are shifting and inconsistent as legitimate recipients of resources (Hampel et al. 2019). More broadly, initially attaining legitimacy is a different process from maintaining it over time (Fisher et al. 2016). If startup investors, journalists, and early customers are already sold on a venture’s initial product claims, managing their expectations could prove daunting; any marked departure jeopardizes that support. Firms that deviate from widely shared expectations typically incur penalties (Zuckerman 1999, Hsu et al. 2009), although managers may be able to mitigate them by placating audiences affected by unexpected changes in strategy (Dalpiaz and Di Stefano 2018). Ventures operating in nascent domains—where categorical norms do not yet exist—face additional complications: as pioneers of “category-defying” products and services that lack business precedent (Zuzul and Edmondson 2017, p. 303), they establish their own expectations. A strategic reorientation thus represents a deviation from expectations that the ventures themselves have set; whether they suffer similar penalties and how they might mitigate them remain unexamined.

  

In sum, existing research, although valuable, leaves important facets of strategic reorientation unexplored. How do ventures manage the process of strategic reorientation? How do they communicate with audiences about fundamental redirections in strategy? These are the questions that we address.

  

# 📜Vague Language, Founding Team Human Capital, and Resource Acquisition

## Introduction

  

The strategic impacts of firms’ use of vague language have become a topic of discussion in several contexts within management. Vagueness in language is defined as an effect caused by a speaker in which “the information [received] lacks the expected precision” (Fraser 2010, p. 26) or “that which modifies a linguistic item…to make its meaning less precise” (Drave 2002, p. 25). When using vague language, a speaker “attenuates…the full semantic value” of the language the speaker is using by adjusting the speaker’s choice of words (Fraser 2010, p. 15). The use of vague language has both pragmatic (informational) and semantic (expressional) roles in communication and is shown to influence investor opinions about a focal firm (Guo et al. 2019) and the competitive behavior of firms’ competitors by altering the perception of the communicating firm (Guo et al. 2017, 2020). Existing work has done little to differentiate between vagueness that reflects underlying information, such as lack of clarity, newness, or risk (vagueness in information), and vagueness that is a mere semantic decision made by a speaker to express a more abstract sentiment or implication (vagueness in expression). This distinction is especially important in entrepreneurial settings, in which a lack of traditionally informative signals leads to audiences relying heavily on communications such as

  

founders’ pitches (Li and Chi 2013, Petty et al. 2023). Thus, it remains unclear whether and when using vague language is effective in an entrepreneurial setting.

  

New technologies, novel business models, emerging industries, and other factors may lead to a fundamental lack of certainty underlying a venture, representing vagueness in information. For example, the inability of a founder to precisely describe the projected performance of a start-up in an emerging industry may be because this is simply difficult to know with the existing information about the underlying market and technological uncertainty. Conversely, the underlying information that exists about a specific context may be relatively certain, but speakers may still employ vague language to manage the expression of this information and the anticipated reaction of their audience, representing vagueness in expression. A founder pitching a medical measuring device, for example, may do so in more certain terms (e.g., “a complete measuring solution with entirely accurate measurements”) or in less certain and more vague terms (e.g., “accurate and reliable measurement solutions”) though the underlying circumstances may be the same.

  

We develop a theoretical framework arguing that, when founders deploy vagueness in expression by using vague language in their pitches (relative to using more linguistically certain pitches) regardless of and controlling for underlying vagueness in information, it is associated with lower interest from investors because of the general antipathy of audiences to vague language. To parse the difference between these types of vagueness, we may look to theories of communication, which differentiate between semantics (the literal words said and their meaning/the abstract reaction invoked in an audience) and pragmatics (the intended meaning and underlying context/information that informs communication) as two different elements of a communicated message (Grice 1975, Jaszczolt 2016). Importantly, however, we also maintain that the ability to use vague language effectively varies with the skills of the founder. Specifically, founders with unique skills in using language (which we call rhetorical human capital) are able to engage in vagueness in expression relatively more effectively. Because this act is independent from underlying information, such as negative elements of the idea, uncertainty in prospects, and so on, it becomes a purely semantic effort for which these types of founders are uniquely equipped. In other words, we propose that vague language in the hands of founders with rhetorical human capital may turn into a useful tool. 1 A series of theory-informed post hoc analyses allows us to explore some of the complex linguistic mechanisms underlying this.

  

To unpack the relationships between vague language, founders’ rhetorical skills, and firms’ ability to acquire interest from investors, we analyze the text of pitches and investor interest following the pitch in the context of a prominent entrepreneurial pitch competition: TechCrunch Disrupt. This competition is recognized as one of the most esteemed and exclusive start-up contests globally (Kanze et al. 2018). More than 700 start-ups have participated in the competition since 2007, raising a cumulative funding amount of $8.8 billion. Because of its popularity and prestige, only a select few start-ups are given the opportunity to present at the TechCrunch Disrupt event with an acceptance rate ranging from 3% to 6%. To measure vagueness, we use text analysis to capture whether the founders’ pitches in the Disrupt pitch competition use vague versus certain language to describe the start-up (Corley and Wedeking 2014, Pezzuti et al. 2021). We also observe the founders’ backgrounds, allowing us to construct a measure of rhetorical human capital.

  

Our findings are consistent with the theory and indicate that, on average, the use of vague language by firms is associated with reduced investor interest. At the same time, the presence of a founder with rhetoric-oriented prior experience or education on a firm’s founding team is associated with greater success in obtaining investor interest when vague language is used. We also estimate a set of alternative specifications and test different measures to ensure the robustness of the results. We include a rich set

  

of controls to condition out the differences in the underlying quality and uncertainty of the ideas and the market context. Our analysis is also facilitated by the fact that TechCrunch is highly selective and only high-potential prescreened companies are included in the events. To assess the sensitivity of our results to the effects of unobserved variables, we utilize a set of recent tools that are recommended for settings in which implementing strictly exogenous designs such as instruments is not possible (Cinelli and Hazlett 2019, Cinelli et al. 2020). We conclude that unobserved effects are unlikely to drive our results. Finally, we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling techniques in a series of post hoc analyses to further explore how founders make use of vague language to impact the overall semantic value of their pitches and influence their audience. These tools are especially relevant in this context as they provide a rich, context-sensitive quantitative understanding of how the adjustment of certain linguistic features influences the overall structure of the pitches. Ultimately, we find evidence to indicate that the use of vague language by founders with rhetoric-oriented human capital is associated with generating pitches that may more easily reach a level of optimal distinctiveness with regard to the linguistic norms of the TechCrunch competition, indicating that one semantic goal of the use of vague language is to manage the distance between a given pitch and the typical pitch in the focal context, potentially balancing distinctiveness and familiarity to achieve an ideal balance. Furthermore, we find evidence that another semantic element of language, risk–reward focus, may play a part in the relationship between vagueness and investor interest. This indicates that vagueness may allow founders to highlight potential rewards despite existing uncertainty or lack of clarity.

  

This study contributes to both the entrepreneurship and strategic human capital literatures in two primary ways. First, it adds to the nascent literature using text analysis techniques to understand how entrepreneurs’ rhetoric may relate to their ability to obtain investor interest by highlighting the importance of vague language. This study highlights the potential uses of vague language in formal funding settings, noting that not all founders have the same efficacy in wielding vague language. Importantly, this paper bridges the gap between the literature on entrepreneurial communication and the broader human capital literature, especially with regards to founding teams, by introducing novel theory surrounding the importance of rhetoric-oriented skills as a conduit through which entrepreneurs successfully acquire resources from third parties. Finally, by making use of topic modeling methods, we begin to explore the multifaceted linguistic mechanisms underlying the relationship between vague expression and audience reactions.

  

## The Impact of Language on Entrepreneurial Outcomes

  

Written and verbal language are key elements of the entrepreneurial funding process. Entrepreneurs engage in the strategic use of language when preparing business plans, giving pitches to investors, writing founder biographies, and preparing any outward-facing rhetoric that expresses vital information about the firm and the founding team to external parties (Whittle et al. 2023). Founders must clearly express who the founding team is and what the firm does when convincing others of its value proposition (Cooper et al. 1988, Arthurs and Busenitz 2003). Entrepreneurs must embed the information they wish to reach third parties in the language they use as well as potentially influencing audience perceptions through tools such as tone, body language, and so on (Clarke et al. 2019). Investors and other stakeholders attempt to assess the potential quality of a firm in the language and accompanying signals directed at them (Amit et al. 1990, Zott and Huy 2007).

  

A growing literature illustrates the impacts of various facets of language on firm outcomes. The use of particular types of idioms and wording is shown to help firms navigate uncertainty and even manage team dynamics and formation (Weick 1995, Cornelissen et al. 2014, Dutta et al. 2024, Gray et al. 2024). Specific to the investment context, angel investors focus on the clarity and understandability of an entrepreneur’s pitch when determining whether they will provide them with funds or not, whereas investors’ own language impacts the perceptions of third parties (Clark 2008, Brauer et al. 2023). Martens et al. (2007) show through qualitative and quantitative analysis of initial public offering prospectuses that firms that employ certain types of entrepreneurial narratives receive more resources than others.

  

Start-ups have unique relationships with strategic language use in comparison with established firms. Start-ups engage in a social process of strategic communication to establish their identity and legitimacy in the eyes of potential resource providers, a process on which incumbents with established records and visible signals of quality are less reliant (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001). These communication processes impact the present and the future; the content of the strategic language used by entrepreneurs may prepare their stakeholders, including potential investors, for pivots that are necessary for start-ups engaged in early stage experimentation (Garud et al. 2014, Camuffo et al. 2019, McDonald and Gao 2019).

  

## Vague Language: Its Intentions and Interpretations

  

Vague language has received significant attention in linguistics and is beginning to be explored more

  

thoroughly in business. Literature in linguistics has reached varying conclusions about the goals and outcomes of vague language use. In terms of handling pragmatic vagueness or vagueness in information, many studies illustrate that, when individuals are uncertain about the value or veracity of what they are saying, they use vague language to avoid addressing underlying issues (Lakoff 1973, Drave 2002, Milanovic and Milanovic 2010). Audiences generally associate vague language with dishonesty, lack of precision, and low performance/low reputation for these reasons (Dulaney 1982, Carpenter 1990, Short and Palmer 2007). From a semantic vagueness or vagueness in expression perspective, vague language can “carry…relevant contextual implications” that are unrelated to omitted or included information (Jucker et al. 2003, p. 1737). Examples include focusing attention in particular directions and using language that takes into account the beliefs, viewpoints, or knowledge of the intended audience to mold their response (McGee 2018).

  

From a pragmatic or informational perspective, the use of vague language is a strategic decision on the part of a speaker to share or avoid sharing specific information or ideas (Channell 1994, Ruzait˙e 2007, Zhang 2013). A speaker may lack information or desire to avoid sharing unflattering information (Fraser 2010, Milanovic and Milanovic 2010). A speaker with a poor understanding of the issues being described to the audience may lack strategic clarity because of the speaker’s fundamental uncertainty (Parnell 2013). Without a precise understanding of the information being conveyed to the audience, the speaker is less likely to use precise language even if the speaker’s intention is to disclose all information available to the speaker.

  

From a semantic or expressive perspective, uncertain language is often used to express vagueness with the objective of softening the impact of language or avoiding direct claims or commitments, the goal being to describe probability or possibility rather than certainty (Salager-Meyer 1994). 2 Importantly, linguistic vagueness in this case is linked to the use of words or phrases that reduce the specificity and precision of a statement (Channell 1994, Guo et al. 2017) but not necessarily to the avoidance or obfuscation of specific information.

  

Unsurprisingly, there is significant literature highlighting the downsides of vague language with a primary focus on its informational role because of its use as a tool to mitigate the negative connotations of more precise language when the underlying information may be negative (Leech 2000). A variety of studies on languagebased impression management in accounting highlight self-serving uses of vague language (Neu 1991, Brennan et al. 2009). The core of this literature is that managers wish to obfuscate negative information and, as a result, communicate with third parties using language that allows them to avoid sharing this information without explicit dishonesty (Adelberg 1979, Courtis 1995). Though they are restricted pragmatically from outright excluding the information from their disclosures (a pragmatic communication issue that would fall under research about fraud), firms communicate unflattering information using language that differs semantically from more positive disclosures, deploying vagueness in language to manage the reactions of audiences (Aerts 1994). This phenomenon is not restricted to financial statements; accounting researchers identify similar patterns of vague language use in earnings conference calls and even in the communication of new accounting standards by regulatory bodies (Young 2003, Dzieli´nksi et al. 2017). Similar mechanisms may apply to entrepreneurs; an entrepreneur in search of funding is likely to act in a self-interested manner and, as a part of the entrepreneur’s many utterances to potential investors, is likely to engage in vague language.

  

These efforts do not go unnoticed by the audience, however. The use of vague language is linked to perceptions of apprehensiveness or deceptiveness on the part of the speaker (Dulaney 1982, Colwell et al. 2002, Zhou and Hripcsak 2007, Geppert and Lawrence 2008). This contrasts with more certain language, which is viewed as straightforward and assertive (Carpenter 1990). In the context of entrepreneurship, potential investors closely observe the language used by entrepreneurs to obtain otherwise unavailable information. A close examination of vague language may lead audiences, especially knowledgeable ones such as venture capitalists, to question whether negative information is being obfuscated by the speaker. It is, therefore, likely that audiences are concerned with vague language and that they will not only take note of it but may allow it to affect their impression of the focal firm and, as a result, their investment decision.

  

In line with this, we predict that, on average, investors interpret the use of vague language as driven by negative underlying information or high uncertainty about the prospects of the business. This is despite the fact that it may be that vague language is being used purely for expressive rather than informational purposes; we hypothesize that the established negative preconceptions most audiences have about vague language will manifest in a negative reaction to vagueness in expression even in the presence of positive information that would reduce vagueness in information on the side of the audience. Consequently, the use of vague language by entrepreneurs is generally associated with less success in acquiring external funding, which is preceded by lower investor interest (Bernstein et al. 2017, Bapna and Ganco 2021). 3 Consequently, we hypothesize the following.

  

Hypothesis 1. Fewer investors express interest in investing in firms that use vague language in investor-facing communications than firms that use more concrete language.

  

Despite the generally negative connotations of vague language, there are circumstances in which it may prove helpful. There are multiple theoretical mechanisms by which the use of vague language might be beneficial for entrepreneurs. One of the primary differentiators between vague language that is perceived negatively versus positively is the tailoring of that language to a nuanced understanding of the audience’s preferences and knowledge. Studies in linguistics indicate that vague language that draws on a shared understanding, experience, or common ground between the speaker and the audience is especially effective (Overstreet and Yule 1997, McGee 2018). A lack of precision can be beneficial if it is based on an understanding of the audience and its needs (Leech 2000, Cheng and Warren 2001, Gassner 2012, Zhang 2013). This may be particularly useful in certain pitching circumstances; for example, entrepreneurs may use more vague language when addressing parties whom they expect to be less knowledgeable or experienced about their venture or industry. Founders may feel the need to use less precise or less certain language when communicating about a venture with a panel of generalist investors or investors with limited experience in their subfield. In such a case, the use of more vague language might aid the entrepreneur in expressing ideas and the state of the entrepreneur’s venture in a way that the audience can fully grasp. In addition, if an entrepreneur is concerned that differences from the norm in the entrepreneur’s team or venture may not signal legitimacy or other favorable traits compared with other firms, vagueness in expression may draw attention away from this.

  

But when are entrepreneurs able to achieve this outcome rather than the negative outcome generally associated with the use of vague language? Wielding vague language effectively may be inherently challenging. To assess this, one must return to the entrepreneurship and strategy literature to determine what other factors play a role in the reactions of the firm’s audience, that is, investors. Understanding what drives investors’ decision making when assessing an entrepreneurial venture can inform our understanding of when vague language is negative in its impacts and when it is positive.

  

As is the language used by a firm, the human capital of the founders of a firm is associated with changes in the degree of success the firm has in terms of investment. Founding team skills are associated with more positive assessments of a firm by potential investors and increased investment from them (Colombo and Grilli 2010). Founders who have previously founded or managed firms as well as founders who have specific skills that investors associate with superior performance are assessed positively by investors (Stuart and Abetti 1990, Haeussler et al. 2014, Souitaris et al. 2023). Because external parties such as investors are not able to directly observe quality, they rely on the traits of founders to provide information that is otherwise unavailable.

  

Traditionally, the literature on founders’ skills focuses on founders with business-oriented skills and technically-oriented skills because of the link between these skill sets and basic firm functions. However, we propose that another skill set is relevant in the funding stage: the skill of using language effectively. If the traits of a firm’s language are informative for (and potentially persuasive to) external parties such as funders, it is clear that individuals with a greater degree of skill in using language will have an impact on the firm’s success in using specific types of language.

  

In the case of vague language, this is especially true. As noted above, the success of vague language in being a positive semantic tool is dependent on a nuanced understanding of the audience and its interests and needs. Individuals trained in the art of rhetoric and strategic communication are especially focused on understanding their audience and how to tailor messages specifically to their preferences (Fleming 1998, Paretti 2006, Christopher 2013, Rai et al. 2023). As a result, efforts to educate professionals across fields in the art of audience awareness in rhetoric have proliferated (Overington 1977, Carvalho 2002, Druschke and McGreavy 2016). Further, individuals with education or professional experience relevant to the effective use of rhetoric are trained to understand appropriate word choice and sentence structure (Faigley et al. 1981, Glisan et al. 2007, Beck et al. 2008).

  

It is likely that, when the founding team of a firm includes individuals with these specific skills, they are more capable of leveraging the positive elements of vague language. Firms that have access to this set of skills should be able to, therefore, more effectively bypass the negative impacts of vague language use and access its benefits. In the case of entrepreneurs appealing to investors, each of the potential use cases of vague language set out above may be enhanced by a greater understanding of the use of language and the needs of a specific audience. An understanding of effective communication with different types of audiences may aid entrepreneurs in gaining the interest of investors who are either generalists or outside of their usual setting. Understanding between the parties on either side of a pitch and the potential for rapport in that understanding are integral to establishing and maintaining a relationship between investors and

  

entrepreneurs, which allows both financial and nonfinancial resources to flow to the target firm (Huang and Knight 2017).

  

In line with the above logic, we hypothesize the following.

  

Hypothesis 2. Firms whose founding teams have a greater endowment of skills associated with rhetoric and communication secure more interest from investors when using vague language than those teams that have lesser endowments of that type of skill.
