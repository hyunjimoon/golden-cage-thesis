## Industry Comparison

| Company | Strategy | Commitment Level | Phase Allocation |
|:--------|:---------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| **Motional** | Focused L4 robotaxi | High | 30/70 (early Phase 2) |

## Aurora: Platform-First

Pursued "boundary management" through partnerships with multiple OEMs and logistics companies, preserving optionality across robotaxi, trucking, and delivery segments.

**Strategy**: Platform-first, 70/30 allocation.

---

## Nuro: Forced Pivot

Executed strategic pivots under capital pressure, repositioning from broad autonomy ambitions to focused last-mile delivery.

**Strategy**: Forced Phase 2 entry.

---

## Waymo: Internal Optionality

Maintained segment diversity (robotaxi, trucking via Waymo Via) within a single corporate structure.

**Strategy**: Internal optionality, insulated by Alphabet resources.

---

## Key Insight

These varied trajectories suggest that commitment timing and scope are design choices with material consequences for adaptation capacity.
