## Content (CARE: Reader-loving structure)

We propose a two-phase approach that balances operational capability development with market expansion.

**Key insight**: Market growth rate and operations capability growth rate must remain synchronized.

## Tab-P: Resource Allocation Heuristic

| Phase | Uncertainty | Platform/Collab | Segment/Process |
|:------|:------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| **Phase 1** | High | 70% | 30% |
| **Transition** | Medium | 50% | 50% |
| **Phase 2** | Low | 30% | 70% |

## Four Tools for Managing Commitment-Flexibility

| Tool | Type | Purpose |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|
| **Strategic Ambiguity** | Capitalization | Intentional vagueness enables collaborators to project their optimism |
| **Segment** | Market | Identify distinct market segments with varying uncertainty profiles |
| **Collaborate** | Operations | Develop capabilities through partnerships that preserve flexibility |
| **Evaluate** | Integration | Measure progress; balance market growth and operational capability |

## Phase 1: Segment and Collaborate (NAIL IT)

**Marketing (Segment)**: Maintain optionality across segments until market signals clarify:
- Robotaxi (high uncertainty, consumer-facing)
- Trucking (medium uncertainty, B2B)
- Last-mile delivery (lower uncertainty, controlled environments)

**Operations (Collaborate)**: Develop through partnerships that preserve flexibility:
- Delivery capability: Partner with Uber, Lyft
- Production (Atoms): Collaborate with OEMs (Hyundai, Toyota)
- Production (Bits): Partner with AI startups for perception/planning

---

## Phase 2: Replicate, Processify, Capitalize (SCALE IT)

Following segment validation:
- **Replicate**: Extend proven approaches to new geographies (CA → TX → international)
- **Processify**: Convert ad-hoc practices into repeatable processes
- **Evaluate**: Establish metrics; pursue aggressive capitalization only after operational validation

---

## Phase Transition Trigger

Move from Phase 1 to Phase 2 when:
1. One segment shows 2× higher signal clarity than alternatives
2. Platform capability achieves minimum viable deployment across 2+ segments
3. Collaboration partnerships demonstrate repeatable value creation
