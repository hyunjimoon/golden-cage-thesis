# Gemini Prompt: Citation Strategy Evaluation for Top-Tier Management Journal

---

## Context

I am preparing a PhD dissertation for submission to a **top-tier management journal** (target: Management Science, Strategic Management Journal, Academy of Management Journal, or Organization Science). The paper argues that early-stage funding suppresses venture growth through a "golden cage" mechanism—funding attracts like-minded believers who filter out skeptics, creating governance homogeneity that blocks learning and adaptation.

**Core Finding**: ρ(Funding, Growth) = −0.174 (N=180,994 ventures)

I have two citation strategies for the Literature Review section. Please evaluate which version has a **higher probability of acceptance** at a top-tier management journal.

## Evaluation Questions

Please evaluate:

1. **Publication Probability**: Which version has a higher probability of acceptance at ManSci/SMJ/AMJ/OrgSci?

2. **Reviewer Reception**: How would reviewers at these journals likely react to each version?

3. **Theoretical Contribution Clarity**: Which version better signals a novel theoretical contribution?

4. **Risk Assessment**: What are the specific risks of each approach?

5. **Hybrid Recommendation**: If neither is optimal, what would you recommend combining from both?

## Additional Context

**Paper's Core Contribution**:
- Identifying the "golden cage" mechanism: Funding → Commitment → Believer Selection → Governance Homogeneity → Learning Blockage → Growth Suppression
- Decomposition: dG/dF = (dG/dR) × (dR/dF) = (+) × (−) = (−)

**Strand C is Critical**: The strategic ambiguity literature (Eisenberg 1984, Abdallah 2014) directly explains *why* commitment attracts like-minded believers. This is the paper's theoretical engine. V1 treats this as governance/agency (Jensen & Meckling); V2 treats it as communication/coordination (Eisenberg).

**Target Audience**: Strategy scholars interested in entrepreneurship, VC, and organizational learning.
