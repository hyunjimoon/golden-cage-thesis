## Changes Made

### 1. [¶11] Theory Integration

**BEFORE (Agency Theory Frame)**:
```markdown
I term this dynamic the "golden cage"—a governance structure that provides
resources while constraining adaptation. The cage is structural, not
motivational (cf. Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The distinction matters:
if founders *will not* pivot (moral hazard), then monitor harder.
If founders *cannot* pivot (structural constraint), then redesign governance.
```

**AFTER (Shared Beliefs Frame)**:
```markdown
I term this dynamic the "golden cage." The mechanism is NOT agency-theoretic.
Founders are not shirking; investors are not monitoring failures. Rather,
both parties are *rational* yet collectively trapped.

Van den Steen (2010) explains why: entrepreneurs who pursue a venture are,
by definition, more optimistic about it—a selection effect, not bias.
Investors who fund share this optimism. The result: belief homogeneity
without any party behaving irrationally.

Eisenberg (1984) completes the mechanism: initial strategic ambiguity
enables "unified diversity"—stakeholders project their own interpretations
onto vague visions. But this same mechanism traps the venture later:
any pivot threatens someone's projected interpretation. The cage is structural,
not motivational. The distinction matters: if founders *will not* pivot
(moral hazard), then monitor harder. If founders *cannot* pivot
(structural constraint), then redesign governance.
```

**Key Change**: Jensen & Meckling → Van den Steen + Eisenberg

### 2. [¶25] The Commitment Timing Problem

**ADDED**:
```markdown
Van Mieghem (1998) formalizes this as a *flexible capacity investment*
problem under uncertainty. The optimal policy: commit only when the
covariance between market signals and internal capability is sufficiently
resolved. Premature commitment destroys option value; delayed commitment
forfeits scale economies.

We translate this operational logic to venture strategy: **Commit to
Reposition, Not Position.** Maintain strategic flexibility until market
signals justify architectural lock-in.
```

**Key Change**: Added Van Mieghem (1998) as core theoretical anchor

---

### 3. [¶26] A Two-Phase Framework

**BEFORE**:
```markdown
I propose a framework balancing operational capability development with
market expansion (Gawer & Cusumano, 2014). The key insight: market growth
rate and operations capability growth rate must remain synchronized (Fine, 1998).
```

**AFTER**:
```markdown
Building on Van Mieghem's (1998) flexible investment logic, I propose a
framework balancing operational capability development with market expansion.
The key insight: commitment timing should follow the resolution of uncertainty,
not precede it. Fine's (1998) clockspeed principle provides context—industry
evolution rates vary, so commitment timing must be calibrated to
sector-specific dynamics.
```

**Key Change**: Van Mieghem as core, Fine as background context

### 4. References Added

| Citation | Journal | Role |
|:---------|:--------|:-----|
| **Eisenberg, E. M. (1984)** | *Communication Monographs* | ¶11 - "Unified diversity" mechanism |
| **Van den Steen, E. (2010)** | *American Economic Review* | ¶11 - Belief homogeneity via selection |
| **Van Mieghem, J. A. (1998)** | *Management Science* | ¶25-26 - Flexible capacity investment |

## Strategic Logic

### Why This Approach?

| Dimension | Safe Approach | Reason |
|:----------|:--------------|:-------|
| ¶9-11 Core | Van den Steen (2010) | Direct mechanism for belief homogeneity |
| ¶9-11 Support | Eisenberg (1984) | "Unified diversity" explains early ambiguity → later trap |
| ¶25-26 Core | Van Mieghem (1998) | ManSci-level mathematical rigor |
| ¶25-26 Background | Fine (1998) | Context without direct extension claim |

### What We Avoided

- ❌ Claiming "Cognitive Specialized Asset" extends Stern's work (unverified)
- ❌ Claiming "Strategic Ambiguity = CE Buffer" extends Fine's work (stretched)
- ❌ Direct attacks on Jensen & Meckling (unnecessary conflict)

### What We Achieved

- ✅ Novel theoretical contribution visible (Van den Steen + Eisenberg)
- ✅ ManSci-level rigor in prescription (Van Mieghem)
- ✅ Safe positioning that doesn't overclaim extension
- ✅ Stern/Fine remain as background, not challenged

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Review with Advisor(s) before Qualifying Exam
2. [ ] Verify Van den Steen (2010) and Van Mieghem (1998) are cited correctly
3. [ ] Consider adding transition paragraph between ¶11 and ¶25 for coherence

*Safe approach implemented. Ready for advisor review.*
