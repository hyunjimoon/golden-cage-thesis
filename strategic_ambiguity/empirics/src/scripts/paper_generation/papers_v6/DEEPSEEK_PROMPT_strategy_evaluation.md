# DeepSeek Prompt: Current vs. Gemini Hybrid Citation Strategy

---

## Context

I am preparing a PhD dissertation on "**The Golden Cage: How Early Funding Suppresses Venture Growth**" for submission to **Management Science, SMJ, AMJ, or Organization Science**.

**Core Finding**: ρ(Funding, Growth) = −0.174 (N=180,994 ventures)

**Core Mechanism**: Funding → Commitment → Believer Selection → Governance Homogeneity → Learning Blockage → Growth Suppression

I have received two strategic recommendations for my Literature Review citations. Please evaluate which strategy has a **higher probability of acceptance** at a top-tier management journal.

## Strategy A: CURRENT (As-Is in Thesis)

**Philosophy**: Use established canonical papers throughout.

### Current Citation Pattern

| ¶ | Key Citations | Theoretical Frame |
|:-:|:-------------|:------------------|
| **7-8** | Kerr (2014), Barney (1991), Penrose (1959), Trigeorgis (1996) | Resource-Based View + Real Options |
| **9-11** | Gompers & Lerner (2001), Hellmann & Puri (2002), **Jensen & Meckling (1976)**, Cyert & March (1963) | **Agency Theory** as core frame |
| **16-18** | Porter (1996), Ghemawat (1991), McGrath (1999), Zuzul & Tripsas (2020) | Commitment vs. Flexibility |
| **25-26** | Adner & Levinthal (2004), Teece et al. (1997), **Fine (1998)**, Gawer & Cusumano (2014) | Dynamic Capabilities + Clockspeed |

### Current Strategy Characteristics
- Heavy reliance on "must-cite" canonical papers
- **Jensen & Meckling (1976)** as primary theoretical anchor for mechanism
- Fine (1998) "Clockspeed" book for scaling
- Standard, expected citation pattern
- **Risk**: May appear as name-dropping; mechanism explanation less precise

---

## Strategy B: GEMINI HYBRID (Recommended by Gemini EIC Analysis)

**Philosophy**: "적의 무기로 적을 치는" - Use classics to set up, then defeat with newer mechanism-specific papers.

### Gemini's Recommended Changes

| ¶ | Current | Gemini Recommendation | Rationale |
|:-:|:--------|:---------------------|:----------|
| **7-8** | Kerr, Barney, Penrose, Trigeorgis | **KEEP AS-IS** | "상식적 배경으로 반전 효과 극대화" |
| **9-11** | Jensen & Meckling (1976) | **REPLACE WITH**: Van den Steen (2004), Eisenberg (1984) | "Agency Theory → Shared Beliefs Theory" |
| **16-18** | Porter, Ghemawat, Zuzul | **EMPHASIZE Zuzul & Tripsas (2020)** | "고전을 최신으로 격파" |
| **25-26** | Fine (1998), Gawer | **REPLACE WITH**: Van Mieghem (1998), Fine (1986) | "Practitioner → Mathematical rigor" |

### Key Theoretical Shift: ¶9-11

**Current Frame (Agency Theory)**:
> "The constraint is structural, not motivational (cf. Jensen & Meckling, 1976). If founders *will not* pivot (moral hazard), then monitor harder."

**Gemini's Frame (Shared Beliefs)**:
> "This is NOT moral hazard. It's belief homogenization. Van den Steen (2004) shows investors who fund share the founder's beliefs—creating systematic homophily. Eisenberg (1984)'s 'unified diversity' explains how initial ambiguity attracts diverse believers who later resist reinterpretation."

### Gemini Hybrid Characteristics
- ¶7-8: Classic setup (unchanged)
- ¶9-11: **Van den Steen + Eisenberg** replaces Jensen & Meckling
- ¶16-18: Zuzul emphasized over Porter/Ghemawat
- ¶25-26: **Van Mieghem (1998)** mathematical model replaces Fine (1998) book
- **Benefit**: More precise mechanism; novel theoretical contribution visible
- **Risk**: Some reviewers may not recognize Van den Steen/Eisenberg

## Side-by-Side: The Critical ¶9-11 Decision

### Current (Agency Theory Frame)

```markdown
### [¶11] Theory Integration

I term this dynamic the "golden cage"—a governance structure that provides
resources while constraining adaptation. The cage is structural, not
motivational (cf. Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The distinction matters:
if founders *will not* pivot (moral hazard), then monitor harder.
If founders *cannot* pivot (structural constraint), then redesign governance.
```

**Implication**: The paper positions itself AGAINST agency theory but still cites it as the primary reference.

### Gemini Hybrid (Shared Beliefs Frame)

```markdown
### [¶11] Theory Integration

I term this dynamic the "golden cage." The mechanism is NOT agency-theoretic.
Founders are not shirking; investors are not monitoring failures. Rather,
both parties are *rational* yet collectively trapped.

Van den Steen (2004) explains why: entrepreneurs who pursue a venture are,
by definition, more optimistic about it—a selection effect, not bias.
Investors who fund share this optimism. The result: belief homogeneity
without any party behaving irrationally.

Eisenberg (1984) completes the mechanism: initial strategic ambiguity
enables "unified diversity"—stakeholders project their own interpretations.
But this same mechanism traps the venture later: any pivot threatens
someone's projected interpretation.
```

**Implication**: The paper offers a NOVEL theoretical contribution distinct from agency theory.

## Gemini's Key Argument

> "리뷰어들은 단순히 '데이터가 이렇다'는 사실에 감동하지 않습니다.
> 그들은 **'우리가 50년 동안 믿어온 이론 중 무엇이 틀렸고,
> 왜 당신의 새로운 메커니즘이 더 우월한가'**를 보고 싶어 합니다."

> "Strand C(Ambiguity)를 단순한 '소통의 기술'로 치부하지 마십시오.
> 리뷰어들은 이것을 **'정보의 비대칭성 속에서 발생하는 합리적 선택의 비극'**으로
> 읽고 싶어 합니다."

## Evaluation Questions for DeepSeek

Please evaluate:

### 1. Theoretical Positioning
- Which strategy better positions the paper as a **novel theoretical contribution** rather than an empirical extension?
- Is replacing Jensen & Meckling with Van den Steen + Eisenberg a wise move, or does it sacrifice established credibility?

### 2. Mechanism Clarity
- Which frame (Agency Theory vs. Shared Beliefs) more precisely explains the "golden cage" mechanism?
- Does the Van den Steen "selection-based homophily" argument strengthen or complicate the story?

### 3. Reviewer Reception
- How would ManSci reviewers react to each strategy?
- How would SMJ reviewers react to each strategy?
- Which journals favor novel theoretical framing vs. canonical citation coverage?

### 4. Risk Assessment
- **Current Strategy Risk**: Appears derivative? Mechanism unclear?
- **Gemini Hybrid Risk**: Van den Steen/Eisenberg not recognized? Appears idiosyncratic?

### 5. Final Recommendation
- Which strategy has higher probability of R&R (Revise & Resubmit) at ManSci/SMJ?
- If neither is optimal, what specific modifications would you recommend?
