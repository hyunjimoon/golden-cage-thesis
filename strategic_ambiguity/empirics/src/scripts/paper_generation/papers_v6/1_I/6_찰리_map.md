## Content

The thesis proceeds as follows:

- **Section CFR** demonstrates that funding inhibits repositioning (dR/dF < 0) and articulates the golden cage mechanism
- **Section FRG** establishes that repositioning drives growth (dG/dR > 0)
- **Section P** develops prescriptive implications for commitment timing
- **Section C** concludes with contributions and limitations

## Roadmap

```
I (WHY dG/dF<0?)
    ↓
CFR (HOW trapped? dR/dF<0)
    ↓
FRG (WHAT grows? dG/dR>0)
    ↓
P (WHEN to commit?)
    ↓
C (SO WHAT?)
```

|:------:|:--:|:---------|:--------|
| I | 1-6 | WHY $ ≠ G? | dG/dF = (+)×(−) = (−) |
| CFR | 7-15 | HOW trapped? | dR/dF < 0 |
| FRG | 16-24 | WHAT grows? | dG/dR > 0 |
| P | 25-27 | WHEN commit? | Phase 1→2 |
| C | 28-29 | SO WHAT? | Move to grow |
