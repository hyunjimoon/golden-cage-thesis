## ¶12. The Positioning Doctrine

Strategy scholarship privileges positioning. Porter (1980, 1985) argued that competitive advantage derives from occupying defensible positions within industry structures: find a position, defend it, extract rents. Applied to entrepreneurship, this doctrine becomes a signaling prescription: precise positioning reduces information asymmetry (Spence, 1973).

The logic: if investors cannot observe venture quality, founders must signal through costly commitments. Specific roadmaps, detailed milestones, and precise market definitions serve as credible signals—difficult for low-quality ventures to imitate. The prescription—be precise to signal quality—pervades both literature and practice.

## ¶13. Entrepreneurship Differs

Yet entrepreneurship operates under conditions that challenge this doctrine. New ventures confront undefined markets, unproven technologies, and evolving customer needs. The lean startup methodology (Ries, 2011) assumes initial hypotheses will be wrong, making adaptation essential.

The empirical record: Instagram pivoted from Burbn to photo sharing. Slack transformed from gaming to messaging. YouTube began as video dating. These pivots succeeded not despite abandoning initial positions but because of that flexibility.

This creates tension: the positioning doctrine prescribes precision while entrepreneurial reality rewards adaptation. We investigate which matters more—position or movement—using 180,994 ventures.

*The gospel says position determines success. We find movement matters more.*
