# Paper M1 Section 2: Puzzle (Lines 14-15)

## ¶14. The Movement Principle

We establish the **Movement Principle**: ventures that adapt outperform those that stay fixed, regardless of direction. Formally, dG/dA > 0. This challenges the positioning doctrine's emphasis on finding the "right" position.

The evidence is robust across specifications, time periods, and subsamples. Movers succeed at 1.6× the rate of stayers (17.7% versus 10.8%, p < 0.001). Direction—whether ventures narrow (zoom in) or broaden (zoom out)—matters far less than movement itself. Strategic value lies in adaptive capacity, not in choosing the correct direction ex ante.

## ¶15. Paper M1 Contribution and Structure

Paper M1 provides the first large-scale evidence that strategic flexibility has inherent value in entrepreneurship. Prior literature documents successful pivots through cases (Blank 2013; Ries 2011), but no study has quantified movement's value across a population. Our analysis of 180,994 ventures addresses this gap.

Structure: Section 3 defines variables—vagueness (V), direction (D), adaptability (A), early funding (E), and growth (G)—within strategic coherence literature. Section 4 presents the 1.6× mover advantage. Section 5 interprets findings. Section 6 acknowledges limitations and previews the Funding Paradox.
