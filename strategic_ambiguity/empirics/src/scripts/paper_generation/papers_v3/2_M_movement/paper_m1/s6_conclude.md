# Paper M1 Section 6: Conclusion (Lines 27-29)

## ¶27. Summary of Contributions

Paper M1 establishes the Movement Principle—dG/dA > 0—demonstrating that movement, not position, determines entrepreneurial success. Three key findings support this conclusion. First, movers succeed at 1.6× the rate of stayers (17.7% versus 10.8%), representing a 6.9 percentage point absolute advantage. Second, movement direction (zoom in versus zoom out) barely matters; the 1.0 percentage point difference between directions is negligible compared to the mover-stayer gap. Third, Q3 ventures (V = 50-75) show the highest success not because moderate vagueness is optimal, but because moderate vagueness enables the highest movement rate (68%).

These findings challenge the positioning doctrine that has dominated strategy scholarship since Porter (1980). The emphasis on finding and defending the "right" position appears misplaced in entrepreneurial contexts characterized by uncertainty and rapid environmental change. Strategic flexibility—the capacity to adapt positioning in response to market feedback—creates value that static positioning analysis cannot capture.

## ¶28. Limitations and Boundary Conditions

Our analysis faces important limitations that bound the generalizability of these findings. First, correlation does not establish causation. Movement and success may share common causes—perhaps higher-quality founders both move more and succeed more. Selection effects may also operate: successful ventures may have resources enabling movement, creating reverse causality. Second, our vagueness measure captures positioning breadth but not strategic quality. A venture could be vague due to unfocused thinking rather than deliberate ambiguity, and our measure cannot distinguish these cases. Third, our primary outcome measure (funding multiples) may not equal business success; subsequent funding reflects investor beliefs that may prove incorrect.

Future research should pursue causal identification through instrumental variables or natural experiments, examine movement dynamics (optimal timing and magnitude), explore heterogeneity across industries and founder characteristics, and investigate mechanisms explaining why movement helps.

## ¶29. Transition to Paper M2

Paper M1 established that movement helps growth (dG/dA > 0). This creates an apparent puzzle: if movement is valuable, and funding enables experimentation, why do better-funded ventures show worse outcomes? The observed correlation ρ(G, E) = −0.196 (p < 0.001) contradicts the expectation that resources should enable the adaptation that drives success.

Paper M2 resolves this puzzle through the Fund2Cage mechanism. The total effect decomposes as:

$$\frac{dG}{dE} = \frac{dG}{dA} \cdot \frac{dA}{dE} = (+)(-) < 0$$

Funding constrains the very adaptation that drives success. The commitment required to secure funding locks ventures into positions they cannot easily abandon. The cage is golden—it provides resources—but it traps ventures in positions that may prove suboptimal as markets evolve.

The ventures that ultimately succeed are those ready to abandon their current position to find better ones; those who cling to their initial positioning will fail. The positioning doctrine says position determines success. Paper M1 rejects this gospel.
