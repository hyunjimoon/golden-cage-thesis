## ¶16. Two Views of Strategic Coherence

Prior literature offers two perspectives on strategic coherence. The **static coherence** view, exemplified by Stern and colleagues, emphasizes fit among customer, technology, organization, and competition at any given moment—a spatial clustering requirement. The **dynamic coherence** view, developed by Furr and Eisenhardt, emphasizes that different lifecycle phases (nail, scale, sail) require evolving organizational cultures—a temporal phasing requirement.

Neither perspective directly addresses how positioning breadth should evolve over the venture lifecycle. The static view takes positioning as given; the dynamic view focuses on culture rather than positioning. This dissertation fills the gap by examining how changes in positioning breadth—movement along the vagueness dimension—relate to venture outcomes.

## ¶17. Variable Definitions

We define five variables central to our analysis. **Vagueness** (V) captures positioning breadth on a 0-100 scale, where higher values indicate broader, less specific strategic positioning. **Direction** (D) measures the change in vagueness between the initial and terminal periods (V_T − V₀), with negative values indicating focusing (zoom in) and positive values indicating broadening (zoom out). **Adaptability** (A) equals the absolute value of direction (|D|), capturing movement magnitude regardless of direction. **Early Funding** (E) measures initial capital raised in log USD. **Growth** (G) measures performance outcomes, operationalized as subsequent funding multiples.

Table 1 summarizes these definitions and their ranges.

| Variable | Symbol | Definition | Range |
|:---------|:------:|:-----------|:------|
| Vagueness | V | Positioning breadth | 0-100 |
| Direction | D | Change in vagueness (V_T − V₀) | Signed |
| Adaptability | A | Absolute movement (\|D\|) | ≥ 0 |
| Early Funding | E | Initial capital (log USD) | Continuous |
| Growth | G | Performance outcome | ≥ 1 |

## ¶18. Growth Measurement

We operationalize growth using two complementary measures. Our primary measure, **G₁** (funding multiple), equals total funding raised divided by initial funding (F_t / E). This measure achieves 100% coverage across our sample and directly captures capital attraction—a key indicator of investor-perceived value creation. Our secondary measure, **G₂** (operational growth), uses PitchBook's proprietary GrowthRate metric where available (41% coverage).

We report results primarily using G₁ given its universal availability. The funding multiple reflects market assessments of venture progress and can be interpreted as a revealed preference measure: investors allocate subsequent capital to ventures demonstrating progress. Results using G₂ provide robustness checks and acknowledge potential survivorship bias inherent in funding-based measures.

## ¶19. The Signaling Theory Prediction

Signaling theory (Spence, 1973) predicts that precision helps ventures attract resources. The logic proceeds as follows: founders possess private information about venture quality that investors cannot directly observe; credible signals enable separation between high- and low-quality ventures; specific commitments are harder for low-quality ventures to fake; therefore, more precise positioning should yield better outcomes.

This generates our null hypothesis: **H₀: Position determines success**. We test position effects rather than vagueness specifically to assess the positioning doctrine's core claim. Module T later addresses why excessive precision may trigger learning traps, but Paper M1 focuses on the fundamental question: Does position or movement matter more for venture success?
