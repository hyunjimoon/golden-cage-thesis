## ¶20. Movement Beats Position

Our central finding challenges the positioning doctrine: movement—not initial position—predicts venture growth. Formally, dG/dA > 0, establishing what we term the Movement Principle. This result holds across multiple specifications and time periods, suggesting that strategic flexibility creates value independent of the specific positioning choices ventures make.

Initial positioning explains minimal variance in outcomes. Ventures starting at similar vagueness levels show widely divergent trajectories, while ventures that move—regardless of initial position—systematically outperform those that stay fixed. The data support a clear interpretation: entrepreneurial success depends more on adaptive capacity than on selecting the "correct" initial position.

## ¶21. The 1.6× Mover Advantage

Table 2 presents our primary finding: movers succeed at 1.6 times the rate of stayers.

| Group | Success Rate | 95% CI |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Stayed (A = 0) | 10.8% | [10.5%, 11.1%] |
| **Moved (A > 0)** | **17.7%** | [17.1%, 18.3%] |

The absolute risk increase of 6.9 percentage points (17.7% − 10.8%) represents an economically significant difference. The number needed to treat (NNT) equals 14, meaning that for every 14 ventures that move rather than stay, one additional success occurs. The relative risk of 1.64 indicates that movers are substantially more likely to succeed than stayers.

This finding can be interpreted through a real options lens: movement represents option exercise, and the 1.6× advantage quantifies the value of exercising rather than merely holding strategic options. Ventures that adapt are not merely lucky—they systematically outperform those that remain fixed in their initial positions.

## ¶22. Non-Monotonic Pattern by Quartile

Contrary to both positioning doctrine (which predicts Q1 success) and simple strategic ambiguity theory (which predicts Q4 success), we observe an inverted-U pattern across vagueness quartiles. Table 3 presents success rates and movement rates by initial vagueness quartile.

| Quartile | V Range | Success | Movement Rate |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|
| Q1 (precise) | 0-25 | 12.3% | 42% |
| Q2 | 25-50 | 8.9% | 35% |
| **Q3** | **50-75** | **16.0%** | **68%** |
| Q4 (vague) | 75-100 | 12.9% | 55% |

The Q3 quartile shows the highest success rate (16.0%), substantially exceeding both Q1 (the signaling theory prediction) and Q4 (the strategic ambiguity prediction). Notably, Q3 stayers show the lowest success rate (6.6%) among all quartile-specific stayer rates. Q3's aggregate success derives entirely from its highest movement rate (68%) combined with the mover advantage—not from positioning superiority. This finding suggests that vagueness creates movement capacity, and movement—not vagueness itself—drives success.

## ¶23. Direction Irrelevance

A striking finding emerges: movement direction matters far less than movement itself. Table 4 compares success rates by direction.

| Direction | Success Rate | 95% CI |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| 🔴 Zoom In (D < 0) | 17.6% | [16.8%, 18.4%] |
| 🔵 Zoom Out (D > 0) | 18.6% | [17.8%, 19.4%] |

The 1.0 percentage point difference (Cohen's h = 0.027) is negligible compared to the 6.9 percentage point mover-stayer gap. Confidence intervals overlap substantially, confirming that direction does not significantly affect success. Whether ventures focus (zoom in) or broaden (zoom out), they outperform stayers by approximately 1.6×.

This direction irrelevance finding carries important theoretical implications. The value of strategic flexibility derives not from finding the "right" direction but from maintaining adaptive capacity. Both focusing and broadening succeed—what matters is the willingness and ability to move when circumstances warrant.
