# Paper M1 Section 5: Implications (Lines 24-26)

## ¶24. Effect Size Interpretation

The 1.6× mover advantage represents a substantial effect size with practical significance. Table 5 presents multiple interpretations of this finding.

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Absolute Risk Increase | 6.9 pp | 17.7% − 10.8% |
| **NNT** | **14** | 1 extra success per 14 movers |
| Relative Risk | 1.64 | Movers 1.6× more likely to succeed |
| Attributable Risk | 39% | 39% of mover success attributable to movement |

The attributable risk interpretation is noteworthy: 39% of mover success can be attributed to movement itself rather than to selection effects or baseline success rates. This suggests that strategic flexibility creates substantial value—value that ventures forego when they remain fixed in their initial positions.

The Movement Principle reconciles competing theoretical traditions. Signaling theory correctly identifies that precision helps ventures attract resources—conditional on remaining fixed. Strategic ambiguity theory correctly identifies that vagueness preserves options—but these options must be exercised to create value. Our contribution demonstrates that neither the position itself nor the options it preserves matter as much as the willingness to exercise those options through strategic movement.

## ¶25. Practical Implications for Entrepreneurs

For entrepreneurs, these findings suggest a reorientation of strategic priorities. The emphasis on "getting it right the first time" may be misplaced; adaptive capacity matters more than initial accuracy. Vagueness serves as insurance against environmental uncertainty, preserving the option to pivot when market feedback demands change. Perhaps most importantly, the data suggest an action bias: the cost of staying fixed exceeds the cost of moving in a suboptimal direction.

The Q3 optimality finding carries specific tactical implications. Starting with moderate vagueness (V = 50-75) maximizes movement capacity without sacrificing focus entirely. This "constructive ambiguity" zone enables both learning and execution—vague enough to preserve options, precise enough to attract initial resources and maintain organizational coherence.

## ¶26. Practical Implications for Investors

For investors, the Movement Principle suggests funding trajectories rather than positions. A venture's initial positioning predicts less about success than its demonstrated adaptive capacity. Past movement—evidence that the founding team can recognize market signals and adjust accordingly—predicts future success more reliably than static positioning assessment.

This creates a natural transition to the puzzle addressed in Paper M2: the Funding Paradox. Given that dG/dA > 0 (movement helps growth), we would expect funding to enable movement through experimentation and thereby improve outcomes. Yet the data show dG/dE < 0: better-funded ventures show worse outcomes, not better.

The resolution lies in decomposing the total effect:

$$\frac{dG}{dE} = \frac{dG}{dA} \cdot \frac{dA}{dE} = (+)(-) < 0$$

If dG/dA is positive (movement helps) but dA/dE is negative (funding constrains movement), the product yields a negative total effect. Paper M2 develops this Fund2Cage mechanism: funding constrains the very movement that drives success.
