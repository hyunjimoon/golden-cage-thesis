# Bridge: The Decomposition Equation (Line 30)



## ¶30. The Mechanism Chain



The Movement Principle (dG/dA > 0) and the Funding Paradox (ρ(G,E) < 0) connect through a decomposition equation that reveals the mechanism chain:



$$\frac{dG}{dE} = \frac{dG}{dA} \cdot \frac{dA}{dE} = (+)(-) < 0$$



This equation states that the total effect of funding on growth (dG/dE) equals the product of two component effects: the effectiveness of movement (dG/dA) and the efficiency of funding in producing movement (dA/dE). Paper M1 established that dG/dA > 0: movement helps growth. For the total effect to be negative, we require dA/dE < 0: funding must constrain rather than enable movement. Paper M2 develops this Fund2Cage mechanism, explaining why and how funding constrains adaptation.



The decomposition provides the organizing framework for the remainder of the thesis. Module C examines how the component effects vary across venture archetypes—showing that Zoom In ventures achieve both effectiveness and efficiency while other types exhibit asymmetric patterns. Module T explains when the cage becomes a trap—developing the Commit2Trap condition that predicts belief rigidity from precise commitments. The bridge equation connects the empirical finding (Funding Paradox) to the theoretical mechanism (Fund2Cage) through mathematical decomposition.
