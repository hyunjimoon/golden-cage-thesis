## ¶35. Step 1: Commit → Funding

The first step in the Fund2Cage mechanism establishes that commitment precedes funding. To secure capital, entrepreneurs must articulate what they will do with it. This requires specifying technology roadmaps, market positioning, revenue projections, and milestone schedules. Investors evaluate these commitments to assess both quality (can this team execute?) and fit (does this opportunity match our thesis?).

The commitment requirement is not arbitrary—it serves legitimate purposes. Specific commitments reduce information asymmetry, enabling investors to screen quality. They also create accountability structures that align incentives and enable monitoring. The problem arises not from the commitment itself but from its downstream consequences for strategic flexibility.

## ¶36. Step 2: Funding → Rigidity

The second step shows how funding crystallizes and rigidifies initial commitments. Once capital arrives, multiple mechanisms lock ventures into their stated paths. Stakeholder expectations crystallize around the funded strategy: investors expect execution against the plan they funded, employees join based on the stated mission, and customers engage based on articulated value propositions. Contracts encode specific obligations through use-of-proceeds clauses, milestone requirements, and representations that can trigger legal consequences if violated.

Governance structures formalize accountability to the original thesis. Board seats come with oversight responsibilities; board members who invested based on one strategy may resist pivots to another. Organizational identity begins to form around the committed direction—the venture becomes "the X company" in ways that make changing X psychologically and politically costly.

## ¶37. Step 3: Rigidity → Failure to Adapt

The third step connects rigidity to adaptation failure. When market signals suggest the original strategy is suboptimal, locked-in ventures face barriers to change at every level. No one champions alternatives because doing so conflicts with embedded interests and stated commitments. Sunk costs anchor decisions to past investments rather than future opportunities. Pivoting feels like admitting failure rather than exercising strategic flexibility.

This creates a collective action problem. Even when founders recognize the need to change, convincing stakeholders requires overcoming the very lock-in mechanisms that funding created. The cage may be golden—it provides resources and structure—but it constrains the adaptive responses that drive success.

## ¶38. The Formal Chain

The mechanism can be stated formally as a causal chain affecting the total effect of funding on growth:

$$\frac{dG}{dE} = \frac{\partial G}{\partial A} \cdot \frac{\partial A}{\partial E} = (+)(-) < 0$$

Each component has empirical grounding. The effectiveness term (∂G/∂A) is positive, reflecting the 1.6× mover advantage documented in Paper M1. The efficiency term (∂A/∂E) is negative, reflecting the Fund2Cage constraint that we test empirically in Lines 40-44. The product yields a negative total effect, explaining the Funding Paradox.

## ¶39. Adjustment-of-Commitment Cost

The Fund2Cage mechanism operates through what we term the Adjustment-of-Commitment Cost (AOC):

$$AOC = \text{Sunk Costs} + \text{Stakeholder Resistance} + \text{Identity Disruption}$$

Each component increases with funding. More capital creates more sunk costs as resources flow into the committed path. More investors create more stakeholder resistance as more parties must be convinced to support change. Longer operation under a committed strategy creates more identity disruption as organizational self-conception solidifies around the original direction.

This framework connects to Bayesian learning theory, which Module T develops further. High commitment corresponds to high prior precision (τ) in belief updating. When priors are precise, new evidence has limited impact on posterior beliefs. The Fund2Cage mechanism creates organizational analogs to high-precision priors, limiting the capacity to update beliefs even when evidence warrants change.
