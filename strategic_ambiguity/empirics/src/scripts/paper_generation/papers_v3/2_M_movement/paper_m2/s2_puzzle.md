# Paper M2 Section 2: Puzzle (Line 32)

## ¶32. The Funding Paradox

Paper M1 established that movement drives growth (dG/dA > 0). This creates an expectation: if funding enables experimentation, and experimentation leads to adaptation, then funding should improve outcomes. Yet our data reveal the opposite pattern:

> **ρ(G, E) = −0.196*** (p < 0.001)**

Better-funded ventures show systematically worse growth outcomes. This Funding Paradox represents a central puzzle requiring explanation.

The paradox can be stated precisely. We observe a negative total effect (dG/dE < 0) despite expecting a positive relationship through the experimentation channel. To understand this pattern, we decompose the total effect:

$$\frac{dG}{dE} = \frac{dG}{dA} \cdot \frac{dA}{dE} = (+)(-) < 0$$

We already know that dG/dA > 0 from the Movement Principle. For the total effect to be negative, we require dA/dE < 0: funding must constrain rather than enable adaptation. Paper M2 develops this Fund2Cage mechanism—explaining why and how funding constrains the very movement that drives success.

The puzzle deepens when we consider the economic importance of this relationship. Early-stage ventures make existential decisions about how much capital to raise, at what terms, and from which investors. These decisions carry lasting consequences for subsequent strategic flexibility. Understanding the Fund2Cage mechanism provides actionable guidance for founders, investors, and policymakers navigating the commitment-flexibility tradeoff.
