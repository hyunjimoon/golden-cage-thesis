## ¶34. Paper M2 Structure

Paper M2 proceeds in three parts. The theory section (Lines 35-39) builds the Fund2Cage mechanism through a three-step causal chain: entrepreneurs commit to secure funding, funding crystallizes those commitments, and crystallized commitments create rigidity that prevents adaptive response. Each step receives theoretical grounding and illustrative examples.

The empirics section (Lines 40-44) tests the mechanism's central prediction: dA/dE < 0. We document the statistical significance of this relationship (ρ(A, E) = −0.009, p < 0.001), interpret its economic magnitude, and conduct robustness checks across specifications and time periods. Figure 1 presents a three-panel visualization decomposing the Funding Paradox through the Fund2Cage lens.

The discussion section (Lines 45-48) interprets these findings for theory and practice. We draw implications for entrepreneurs (raise strategically, preserve pivot capacity), investors (don't over-fund, value optionality), and policymakers (design flexible funding structures). We acknowledge limitations—particularly the modest economic magnitude of the documented effect—and preview the heterogeneity analysis developed in Module C, which examines how different venture types experience the Fund2Cage constraint differently.
