## ¶45. Implications for Entrepreneurs

The Fund2Cage mechanism suggests that entrepreneurs should approach fundraising strategically, not merely as resource acquisition. Raising more capital is not uniformly beneficial; the commitment constraints that accompany funding may outweigh the resource benefits. This implies several practical recommendations.

First, entrepreneurs should raise the minimum capital required to reach meaningful milestones rather than the maximum available. Excess capital creates stronger cages without proportionate benefits. Second, deal structures should preserve pivot capacity through flexible milestone definitions, board composition that tolerates strategic evolution, and governance terms that allow strategy updates without triggering adverse consequences. Third, founders should build escape routes into their organizational design—creating cultures that normalize strategic adaptation and relationships that survive pivots.

## ¶46. Implications for Investors

For investors, the Fund2Cage mechanism challenges conventional practices around commitment enforcement. While milestone monitoring serves legitimate purposes, excessive rigidity may destroy value by preventing beneficial adaptations. Several implications follow.

Investors should avoid over-funding portfolio companies, recognizing that excess capital may constrain rather than enable success. Portfolio monitoring should track flexibility indicators alongside traditional KPIs—not just whether companies hit milestones, but whether they retain capacity to pivot when evidence warrants change. Investment decisions should value optionality: funding trajectories with demonstrated adaptive capacity rather than static positions with rigid commitments.

## ¶47. Hypotheses Summary and Limitations

Paper M2 tested three hypotheses. We reject H₀ (position determines success) based on the weak ρ(V, L) = +0.024 relationship. We confirm H₁ (Movement Principle: dG/dA > 0) with ρ(G, A) = +0.044 (p < 0.001). We confirm H₂ (Fund2Cage: dA/dE < 0) with ρ(A, E) = −0.009 (p < 0.001). The heterogeneity hypothesis (H₃) carries forward to Module C.

Important limitations bound these findings. The Fund2Cage effect is economically small; while statistically significant, it explains minimal variance. Causality remains uncertain—the correlation might reflect reverse causality (successful ventures move more) or omitted variables (founder quality drives both). The mechanism is demonstrated correlates with outcomes, but we cannot fully specify the causal pathways involved.

## ¶48. Conclusion and Transition

Paper M2 establishes that funding builds a golden cage: the resources that secure survival restrict the freedom required for growth. The mechanism operates through commitment crystallization—the commitments required to secure funding become rigidified by funding, creating barriers to the adaptation that drives success.

Module C extends this analysis by examining how different venture types experience the Fund2Cage mechanism differently. Not all ventures face identical constraints; initial positioning (vagueness level) and movement direction (zoom in versus zoom out) may moderate the funding-flexibility relationship. Understanding this heterogeneity provides more nuanced guidance for matching funding strategies to venture characteristics.
