## ¶31. Experimentation Requires Capital

Conventional wisdom holds that capital enables experimentation. More funding provides runway to test hypotheses, iterate on products, and explore market opportunities. This view reflects organizational slack theory applied to startup contexts: resources buffer against uncertainty, and better-resourced ventures can afford more experiments before committing to a path.

The logic seems self-evident. Experimentation costs money—each pivot requires development resources, customer acquisition spend, and time that burns cash. Ventures with limited capital face existential pressure to find product-market fit quickly; well-funded ventures can afford patient exploration. The Lean Startup methodology implicitly assumes this resource-experimentation link: build-measure-learn cycles require the capital to actually build and measure.

The gospel, then, is that funding enables adaptation. If the Movement Principle (dG/dA > 0) is correct—if adaptation drives growth—then funding should improve outcomes by enabling the experimentation that leads to adaptation. Better-funded ventures should explore more options, learn faster, and ultimately succeed at higher rates.

Yet this gospel faces an uncomfortable empirical fact: the correlation between early funding and subsequent growth is negative (ρ = −0.196, p < 0.001). Paper M2 explains why funding builds a cage rather than enabling flight.

*The gospel says funding fuels flexibility. We find it builds a cage.*
