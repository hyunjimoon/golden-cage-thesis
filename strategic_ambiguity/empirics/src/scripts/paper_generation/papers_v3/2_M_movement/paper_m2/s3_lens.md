## ¶33. The Fund2Cage Mechanism

The Funding Paradox arises because the causal ordering between commitment and capital is counterintuitive. The naive framing suggests: Capital → Commitment (you commit because you have capital to execute). The correct framing reverses this order: Commitment → Capital → Lock-in (you commit to get capital, then capital locks you in).

This ordering matters critically. Entrepreneurs do not receive funding and then decide to commit; they must commit to secure funding in the first place. The commitment precedes the capital. Once capital arrives, it reinforces and rigidifies the initial commitment through multiple channels: stakeholder expectations crystallize around the stated strategy, contracts encode specific milestones and use-of-proceeds clauses, board structures formalize accountability to the original thesis, and organizational identity begins to form around the committed direction.

The Fund2Cage mechanism operates through this commitment crystallization process. More funding intensifies each lock-in channel: larger rounds attract more investors with more expectations, require more elaborate contracts with more specific terms, build more formal governance with more oversight, and enable more organizational growth that creates more identity formation. The cage is golden because it provides resources for survival. But it traps ventures in positions they cannot easily abandon.

The key insight is that the cage is built not by capital itself but by the commitments that capital requires and reinforces. A bootstrapped venture making the same commitments would face similar constraints. But funded ventures face more pressure to commit more precisely, more publicly, and to more stakeholders—creating denser, stronger cages.

## ¶34. Two Types of Commitment

The Fund2Cage mechanism reveals that commitment type matters as much as commitment level. We distinguish two fundamentally different commitment modes:

| Type | Definition | Effect | Module |
|:-----|:-----------|:-------|:-------|
| **Rigid Commitment** | "We will do X" (locked trajectory) | Attracts funding but blocks pivoting | 🐣M2 (this paper) |
| **Provisional Commitment** | "Let's assume X for now" (design spiral) | Enables action + learning | 🦾C (next chapter) |

This paper focuses on **Rigid Commitment → Fund2Cage**. Module C develops **Provisional Commitment** as the escape mechanism.

The key insight: Both types can attract stakeholders, but only provisional commitment preserves the ability to adapt. Rigid commitment trades future flexibility for present resources. Provisional commitment maintains optionality while enabling coordinated action.
