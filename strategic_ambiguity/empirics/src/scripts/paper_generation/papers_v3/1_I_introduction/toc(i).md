## Paragraph Structure (Updated)

| Line | ¶ | Role | First Sentence | 🔄 |
|:----:|:-:|:-----|:---------------|:--:|
| 1 | 1 | **Entrepreneurship as Experiment** | Entrepreneurship is experimentation—and experimentation requires capital. | ✓ |
| 2 | 2 | **Commitment-Funding Tension** | Commitment enables funding, but funding may constrain adaptation. | ✓ |
| 3 | 3 | **The Empirical Puzzle** | Analyzing 180,860 technology ventures, we find an empirical puzzle: dG/dE < 0. | ✓ |
| 4 | 4 | **The Funding Paradox Hook** | We call this the **Funding Paradox**: when growth measured by funding, more funding may impede growth. | ✓ |
| 5 | 5 | **The Movement Principle** | Our most striking finding: companies that repositioned succeed 1.6× more than those that stayed fixed. | |
| 6 | 6 | **Preview: Fund2Cage** | We propose the **Fund2Cage mechanism**: Commit → Funding → Rigidity → Failure to Adapt. | ✓ |
| 7 | 7 | **Preview: Fund2Growth** | Four mover types show distinct patterns in how funding affects their adaptation paths. | ✓ |
| 8 | 8 | **Preview: Commit2Trap** | High precision creates a learning trap: μ(1−μ) < ε/(V+1). | |
| 9 | 9 | **Central Question** | When does positioning flexibility enable **growth**, and what role does **VC funding** play? | ✓ |
| 10 | 10 | **Contributions** | Three contributions: (1) Movement Principle (**WHAT**), (2) Fund2Cage (**HOW**), (3) Commit2Trap (**WHY/WHEN**). | ✓ |
| 11 | 11 | **Thesis Structure** | This thesis presents I-M-C-T-D following Schubert D.934's fantasy structure. | |

## Three Contributions (Updated)

| # | Contribution | Module | Core Question | Equation |
|:-:|:-------------|:------:|:--------------|:---------|
| **C1** | Movement Principle | M | **WHAT** should strategy be? | dG/dA > 0 |
| **C2** | Fund2Cage Mechanism | C | **HOW** does funding affect movement? | dA/dE < 0 |
| **C3** | Commit2Trap Condition | T | **WHY/WHEN** does cage become trap? | μ(1−μ) < ε/(V+1) |
