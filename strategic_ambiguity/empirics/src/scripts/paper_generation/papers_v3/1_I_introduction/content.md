# Chapter 1: Introduction

## ¶1. Entrepreneurship as Experimentation

The scientific approach to entrepreneurship frames founders as hypothesis-testers who gather evidence, update beliefs, and iterate toward product-market fit (Camuffo et al., 2020; Gans, Stern, & Wu, 2019). Building prototypes, hiring talent, and accessing markets require funding. Venture capital finances this experimentation, providing capital alongside governance, networks, and legitimacy. The standard prediction follows: more funding enables more experiments, faster learning, and better outcomes.

## ¶2. The Commitment-Funding Tension

Yet securing funding requires commitment. To attract investors, entrepreneurs articulate specific technologies, define target markets, and project milestones. These commitments signal quality, reducing information asymmetry (Spence, 1973). Once made, commitments crystallize into expectations. Investors who funded a "battery-swapping infrastructure company" expect battery swapping, not home charging. The stakeholders attracted by precise promises resist change. This creates tension: commitments that secure resources may undermine the flexibility that enables adaptation.

## ¶3. The Empirical Puzzle

We analyze 180,994 ventures funded in 2021, tracking their evolution through 2025. Early funding (E) correlates *negatively* with later growth (G): ρ(G, E) = −0.196 (p < 0.001). Figure 1 displays this pattern—the negative slope contradicts expectations. If resources enable experimentation and experimentation enables success, why do better-funded ventures show worse outcomes? This **Funding Paradox** motivates our investigation. Decomposing the relationship reveals two mechanisms operating in opposite directions: funding reduces strategic movement (dA/dE < 0), but movement drives growth (dG/dA > 0). The constraining effect dominates.

## ¶4. The Funding Paradox Hook

We term this the **Funding Paradox**: more early funding impedes later growth. The mechanism is commitment crystallization, not statistical artifact. Consider Better Place versus Tesla. Better Place secured $850M by promising "battery swaps in exactly 3 minutes"—a precise commitment that attracted believers but blocked pivoting when battery costs dropped 80%. Tesla maintained strategic ambiguity ("accelerate sustainable transportation") that preserved optionality across vehicles, batteries, and storage. The difference was not resources but commitments.

## ¶5. The Movement Principle

Our central finding: what matters is not where ventures start but whether they move. Ventures that repositioned (A > 0) succeed at 17.7%, compared to 10.8% for those that stayed fixed—a **1.6× advantage**. Direction matters little: Zoom In (D < 0) succeeds at 17.6%, Zoom Out (D > 0) at 18.6%. This 1.0 percentage point difference pales against the 6.9 percentage point mover-stayer gap. We term this the **Movement Principle**: exercising strategic options—not merely holding them—drives growth.

## ¶6. Preview: Fund2Cage Mechanism

The **Fund2Cage** mechanism explains why funding constrains movement. Critically, commitment precedes funding: entrepreneurs commit *to get* capital, not because they have it. Three steps: First, entrepreneurs commit to specific promises to secure funding. Second, funding crystallizes commitments through stakeholder expectations and contracts. Third, locked ventures cannot pivot because no one champions alternatives.

The chain rule captures this formally. Assuming G depends on A, which depends on E, with monotonic and differentiable relationships:

$$\frac{dG}{dE} = \frac{dG}{dA} \cdot \frac{dA}{dE} = (+)(-) < 0$$

Adaptation increases growth (positive), but funding reduces adaptation (negative). The compound effect is negative.

## ¶7. Preview: Fund2Growth (4 Mover Types)

The cage is not inherently bad. Like a clinical trial protocol, commitment can discipline experimentation. The question is when the cage becomes a trap. We classify ventures by initial vagueness (V₀) and direction (D = V_T − V₀):

**Stayers** maintain positioning (|ΔV| < 5): 10.8% success. **Horizontal movers** change content but not vagueness: effective when moving (dG/dA > 0), but funding does not reliably produce movement (dA/dE ≈ 0). **Zoom In** (D < −10) start vague, become precise: both effective and efficient (dG/dA > 0, dA/dE > 0). **Zoom Out** (D > +10) start precise, become vague: efficient but saturating (dA/dE > 0, diminishing dG/dA).

Both Zoom In and Zoom Out outperform Stayers. Direction does not determine success; **movement** does.

## ¶8. Preview: Commit2Trap (Precision Paradox)

Signaling theory predicts that precise positioning wins: specific commitments reduce information asymmetry and attract resources. Our data contradict this prediction. Q3 (moderate vagueness, V = 50-75) shows highest growth at 16.0%, outperforming Q1 (precise, 12.3%) and Q4 (vague, 12.9%). The expected winner—Q1—does not win.

We introduce the **Precision Paradox**: initial precision, while attracting resources, creates learning traps. The condition derives from Bayesian updating:

$$\mu(1-\mu) < \frac{\varepsilon}{V+1}$$

When V is low (high precision), the threshold rises, making the trap condition easier to satisfy. Ventures become trapped not because founders are stubborn but because commitment structure leaves no room for belief revision.

## ¶9. The Central Question

This dissertation addresses: **When does positioning flexibility enable growth, and how does funding constrain or enable adaptation?** We operationalize flexibility through vagueness (V), measure adaptation through adaptive capacity (A = |ΔV|), and assess growth through funding multiples (G₁) and operational metrics (G₂).

## ¶10. Three Contributions

Three contributions collectively explain the Funding Paradox:

**C1: The Movement Principle** (Module M) answers WHAT drives success. dG/dA > 0: movement beats position by 1.6×. This challenges the emphasis on finding the "right" position.

**C2: The Fund2Cage Mechanism** (Module C) answers HOW funding affects movement. dA/dE < 0: funding constrains adaptation. Commitment required to secure funding undermines flexibility.

**C3: The Commit2Trap Condition** (Module T) answers WHEN the cage becomes trap. When μ(1−μ) < ε/(V+1), ventures cannot update beliefs even when evidence demands change.

Together: **commit to adaptation, not to outcomes**.

## ¶11. Thesis Structure

Five modules develop interconnected themes following Schubert's D.934 Fantasy structure. Module **I** introduces the Funding Paradox. Module **M** establishes the Movement Principle and Fund2Cage mechanism. Module **C** develops four mover types and archetype heterogeneity. Module **T** explains why precision creates learning traps. Module **D** synthesizes findings for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers.

Like Schubert's fantasy, themes transform and return: the Funding Paradox introduced in I returns with mechanism (M), variation (C), and explanation (T) before resolving (D).
