# Section 1: Theme—The 4 Mover Types Framework (Lines 49-55)

## ¶49. Conventional Wisdom: Funding Enables Learning

Conventional wisdom holds that funding enables learning. Kerr, Nanda, and Rhodes-Kropf (2014) argue that capital enables experimentation, which produces learning. Camuffo et al. (2020) show that resource availability improves hypothesis testing quality and pivot decisions. Gans, Stern, and Wu (2019) demonstrate that capital facilitates evidence gathering that updates founder beliefs. The common prediction: dG/dE > 0 uniformly across venture types—more capital should produce better outcomes regardless of starting conditions.

Yet our data show the opposite: ρ(G, E) = −0.196 (p < 0.001). Module M explained this through the Fund2Cage mechanism: dG/dE = (dG/dA) × (dA/dE) = (+)(−) < 0. But this aggregate decomposition masks important heterogeneity. Module C examines whether the relationship between capital and growth varies systematically by venture type.

## ¶50. Our Finding: Same Funding, Different Outcomes

The E→G relationship varies by archetype. Zoom In and Zoom Out ventures show saturation effects—each additional unit of capital produces diminishing returns to adaptation. Stayers show baseline effects—funding neither helps nor hurts much because they don't move anyway. Horizontal movers show mixed patterns—sometimes moving effectively, sometimes thrashing without progress.

This heterogeneity has important implications. Not all ventures should follow the same funding strategy. The optimal capital-flexibility tradeoff depends on where you start (initial vagueness) and where you're going (movement direction).

## ¶51. The Framework: Classifying Ventures on Two Dimensions

Module M established dG/dA > 0—movement matters more than position. But not all movement is equal. We classify ventures on two dimensions: initial vagueness (V₀, ranging from 0-100) and direction (D = V_T − V₀, which can be positive, negative, or zero). These two dimensions generate four archetypal patterns that partition the space of strategic trajectories.

## ¶52. The Four Types

The intersection of initial position and movement direction yields four types, each with distinct strategic implications:

| Type | Direction | Success Pattern | Color |
|:-----|:---------:|:----------------|:-----:|
| ⚫ **Stayer** | D ≈ 0 | Baseline (10.8%) | Black |
| 🟢 **Horizontal** | D ≈ 0* | Effective but not efficient | Green |
| 🔴 **Zoom In** | D < 0 | **Effective AND efficient** | Red |
| 🔵 **Zoom Out** | D > 0 | Efficient with saturating returns | Blue |

*Horizontal movers show D ≈ 0 in our vagueness measure but substantial keyword change—they move laterally rather than vertically on the vagueness dimension.

## ¶53. Company Examples

Concrete examples illustrate each trajectory type:

| Company | V₀ → V_T | Type | Growth |
|---------|:--------:|:----:|-------:|
| Sky Engine | 28→89 | 🔵 Zoom Out | 215.9× |
| Linpowave | 88→32 | 🔴 Zoom In | — |
| Rubedos | 82→82 | ⚫ Stayer | 2.6× |

Both Zoom In and Zoom Out can succeed spectacularly. Sky Engine began with precise positioning ("AI models for autonomous vehicles") and expanded to a broad platform ("Synthetic data cloud for vision AI"), achieving maximum growth in our sample. Linpowave began vague ("mmWave radar for drones, automobiles, ADAS") and focused to precision ("High-resolution radar for SLAM and traffic"). The common factor: movement. Stayers like Rubedos underperform regardless of their initial position.

## ¶54. Effectiveness × Efficiency

The two-dimensional analysis reveals distinct patterns of effectiveness (dG/dA: does movement help growth?) and efficiency (dA/dE: does funding produce movement?):

| Type | dG/dA (Effectiveness) | dA/dE (Efficiency) |
|:-----|:---------------------:|:------------------:|
| ⚫ Stayer | N/A | N/A |
| 🟢 Horizontal | + | Weak |
| 🔴 Zoom In | + | + |
| 🔵 Zoom Out | + (saturates) | + |

Zoom In ventures show the most favorable profile: movement helps growth (effective) AND funding produces movement (efficient). Zoom Out ventures show efficiency but with diminishing returns as they expand. Horizontal movers are effective when they move but funding doesn't reliably produce that movement. Stayers by definition have no movement to analyze.

## ¶55. Theme Statement

The four-type framework resolves the apparent conflict between signaling theory ("be precise") and strategic ambiguity theory ("be vague"). Both Zoom In and Zoom Out can succeed—if they move. The framework shifts the strategic debate from position to trajectory. What matters is not where you start but whether you adapt.
