# Section 4: Variation 3—🔴 Zoom In (Lines 69-74)



## ¶69. The Zoom In Archetype



Zoom In ventures start with broad, ambiguous positioning and progressively narrow their focus. They move from vague to precise—discovering their niche through experimentation and market feedback. The trajectory reflects a search process: beginning with many possible directions, then converging toward a specific, defensible position.



Linpowave exemplifies the Zoom In trajectory. At V₀ = 88.1, the venture positioned itself broadly as "mmWave radar for drones, automobiles, ADAS"—multiple applications, many potential paths. At V_T = 31.9, it had focused on "High-resolution radar for SLAM and traffic"—a specific application with clear competitive positioning. The ΔV = −56.3 represents substantial focusing: from "we could do many things with radar" to "we do this specific thing excellently."



## ¶70. Both Effective and Efficient



Zoom In ventures exhibit the most favorable pattern: both effectiveness and efficiency. Movement improves growth (dG/dA > 0), and funding reliably produces movement (dA/dE > 0). This combination means that capital invested in Zoom In ventures translates into adaptation, which translates into growth. The mechanism chain works completely.



| Metric | Zoom In | Interpretation |

|--------|:-------:|:---------------|

| dG/dA | **Positive** | Movement effectively drives growth |

| dA/dE | **Positive** | Funding efficiently produces movement |



This pattern emerges because high-V₀ ventures have not yet built the cage. They face less stakeholder lock-in (investors expect search, not execution), lower sunk costs (they haven't invested deeply in one path), and flexible identity (saying "we're still figuring it out" is acceptable). Capital enables exploration: more funding allows more experiments, which accelerates the focusing process.



## ¶71. Initial Vagueness and Direction Tendency



High initial vagueness predicts Zoom In direction. This relationship reflects logical necessity: ventures starting at V = 90 can only move toward precision (they are already at the vague extreme). But beyond mechanical constraints, the pattern reflects strategic logic: vague starters are searching, and searching typically leads to finding, which means focusing.



| Starting V₀ | Most Common Direction | Strategic Interpretation |

|:-----------:|:---------------------:|:-------------------------|

| High (Q4: 75-100) | 🔴 Zoom In | Searching → Finding focus |

| Mid (Q2-Q3: 25-75) | Mixed | Could go either way |

| Low (Q1: 0-25) | 🔵 Zoom Out or ⚫ Stay | Already focused → Expand or lock in |



## ¶72. Success Rate Analysis



Zoom In movers succeed at 17.6%, representing a 1.6× advantage over stayers (10.8%). This confirms the Movement Principle: Zoom In succeeds not because focusing is inherently optimal, but because movement is valuable. The direction matters less than the act of moving.



| Metric | Value | Interpretation |

|--------|:-----:|:---------------|

| Success rate | 17.6% | Absolute success probability |

| vs. Stayers | 1.6× | 17.6% / 10.8% = 1.63× |

| vs. Zoom Out | 0.95× | 17.6% / 18.6% = 0.95× (essentially equivalent) |

| 95% CI | [16.8%, 18.4%] | Tight precision around estimate |



The essential equivalence between Zoom In (17.6%) and Zoom Out (18.6%) reinforces our central argument: direction does not determine success; movement does. Whether ventures narrow or broaden, they outperform ventures that stay fixed.



## ¶73. Theoretical Alignment



The Zoom In pattern aligns with multiple established frameworks in entrepreneurship and strategy. Lean Startup methodology (Ries, 2011) prescribes starting broad and iterating toward product-market fit. The search-and-discover paradigm (Camuffo et al., 2020) emphasizes experimentation to identify winning strategies. Effectuation theory (Sarasvathy, 2001) describes entrepreneurs beginning with means and discovering ends through action. The scientific approach to entrepreneurship (Stern and colleagues) recommends testing hypotheses to converge on truth.



All these frameworks share the Zoom In logic: start with optionality, learn through experimentation, converge toward specificity. Our empirical findings validate this prescription: Zoom In works, achieving 1.6× the success rate of staying fixed.



## ¶74. Key Insight



The Zoom In pattern suggests a clear prescription: initial vagueness provides room for exploration; progressive focusing delivers clarity and execution capability. The combination is powerful because it sequences optionality and commitment appropriately—maintaining flexibility when uncertainty is high, then committing as evidence accumulates.



> **Start vague, find your focus, win.**



This prescription stands in tension with the positioning doctrine's emphasis on initial clarity. Our evidence suggests that getting it "right" initially matters less than developing the capacity to find the right position through adaptive search.



## ¶75. State vs. Trajectory: Critical Distinction

A crucial clarification: Zoom In is a **trajectory**, not a **state**. Being "specific" at time T can arise from two entirely different paths:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TWO WAYS TO BE 'SPECIFIC' (Low V at time T)                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  1. START specific, STAY specific (⚫ Stayer at low V)          │
│     - Example: Mobileye (V₀ = 20 → V_T = 20)                   │
│     - Works IF market doesn't change                           │
│     - Risk: Cannot adapt when disrupted                        │
│                                                                 │
│  2. START vague, BECOME specific (🔴 Zoom In)                   │
│     - Example: Tesla (V₀ = 60 → V_T = 30)                      │
│     - Learns through provisional commitments                   │
│     - Adapts to evidence while focusing                        │
│                                                                 │
│  KEY: Zoom In is a TRAJECTORY, not a STATE                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The distinction matters because the two paths produce fundamentally different organizations. A Stayer at low V has never exercised its learning muscles; it has not built the adaptive capacity that comes from navigating uncertainty. A Zoom In venture at the same final V has learned to learn—it knows how to recalibrate and reframe when evidence demands change.



## ¶76. How Zoom In Works: Provisional Commitment

Zoom In succeeds through the **Design Spiral**:

1. **Start vague** (high V₀) → Preserves optionality
2. **Make provisional commitments** → Enables coordinated action
3. **Execute + Learn** → Evidence accumulates
4. **Recalibrate/Reframe** → Adapt without losing stakeholders
5. **Converge to specific** (low V_T) → Focus with learning

The mechanism is Provisional Commitment—open-ended, mutually affirmed decisions that enable action despite uncertainty. Unlike rigid commitments ("We will do X"), provisional commitments ("Let's assume X for now") preserve the ability to adapt.

See s6_provisional_commitment.md for the full mechanism.
