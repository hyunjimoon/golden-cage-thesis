# Section 6: Provisional Commitment - The Mechanism Behind Movement (Lines 77-80)

## ¶77. From Dreams to Machines

How do successful movers (🔴 Zoom In, 🔵 Zoom Out) actually change their trajectory? Through **Provisional Commitments**—open-ended, mutually affirmed decisions that enable action despite uncertainty.

### Definition

| Feature | Description | Example |
|:--------|:------------|:--------|
| **Temporary** | Explicitly revisable | "Let's assume VTT truss... we can revise later" |
| **Mutually Affirmed** | Collective agreement | Explicit vote or tacit consent |
| **Amid Uncertainty** | Made with incomplete info | A calculated bet |
| **Enables Action** | Provides minimal stability | Work can proceed |

## ¶78. The Design Spiral

The Design Spiral captures how provisional commitments enable movement:

```
Dream ──┬── DISTILLING ──→ Evaluative Criteria
        │                        │
        └── TETHERING ───→ Working Assumptions
                                │
                                ▼
                   PROVISIONAL COMMITMENT
                   "Let's assume X for now"
                                │
                                ▼
                       COLLECTIVE ACTION
                       (Execute + Learn)
                                │
                          ┌─────┴─────┐
                          ▼           ▼
                    RECALIBRATE   REFRAME
                    (adjust       (revise
                     parameters)  criteria)
                          │           │
                          └─────┬─────┘
                                │
                                ▼
                     Cue to revise? ──No──→ Output
                            │
                           Yes
                            │
                            └───────→ Return to PC
```

### Two Adaptation Mechanisms

| Mechanism | When to Use | Example |
|:----------|:------------|:--------|
| **Recalibrate** | Evidence undermines assumptions | 4-point rig unstable → 8-point rig |
| **Reframe** | Criteria need reinterpretation | Physical symmetry → Visual symmetry |

The key distinction: Recalibration adjusts within existing criteria; Reframing changes the criteria themselves. Both preserve stakeholder alignment because the commitment was provisional from the start.

## ¶79. Ecosystem Coordination

Provisional Commitments enable **ecosystem building**:

> "에코 시스템을 장악하는 쪽이 승자가 될 확률이 있다"
> — Industry expert interview

```
Vision (vague enough for partners to join)
         ↓
Provisional Commitment ("Let's try this together")
         ↓
Partner Feedback (OEM validation, pilot data)
         ↓
Recalibrate/Reframe (adapt based on ecosystem signals)
         ↓
Convergence (specific enough to execute)
```

The mechanism works because provisional commitments are explicit about their revisability. Partners join knowing the direction may change; they commit to the search process, not to a fixed outcome.

## ¶80. AV Industry Evidence

| Company | V₀ | V_T | ΔV | Type | PC Used? | Outcome |
|:--------|:--:|:---:|:--:|:-----|:--------:|:--------|
| **Tesla** | 60 | 30 | -30 | 🔴 Zoom In | Yes | $800B+ |
| **Aurora** | 70 | 40 | -30 | 🔴 Zoom In | Yes | Surviving |
| **Waymo** | 65 | 45 | -20 | 🔴 Zoom In | Yes | Focusing |
| **Cruise** | 30 | 30 | 0 | ⚫ Stayer | Rigid | $10B loss |
| **TuSimple** | 25 | 25 | 0 | ⚫ Stayer | Rigid | -99% |
| **Motional** | 24 | 24 | 0 | ⚫ Stayer | Rigid | 40% layoff |

### The Pattern

Movers (Tesla, Aurora, Waymo) used provisional commitments to navigate uncertainty. They started with broad visions, made revisable bets, and adapted based on evidence. Stayers (Cruise, TuSimple, Motional) made rigid commitments early—locking themselves into specific technologies, markets, or timelines before the industry had stabilized.

### Key Insight

> **Movement requires Provisional Commitment.**
> Rigid commitment enables funding but blocks adaptation.
> Stayers are trapped not by lack of vision, but by rigid commitment to it.

The difference between success and failure is not the initial vision—it is the commitment type. Rigid commitments create the Fund2Cage mechanism (Module M2). Provisional commitments create the escape route.
