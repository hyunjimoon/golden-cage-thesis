# Section 5: Variation 4—🔵 Zoom Out (Lines 75-80)



## ¶75. The Zoom Out Archetype



Zoom Out ventures start with narrow, precise positioning and progressively expand their scope. They move from precise to vague—broadening their domain after proving initial capabilities. This trajectory reflects platform emergence: a venture proves value in a specific context, then generalizes that value to broader applications.



Sky Engine exemplifies the Zoom Out trajectory and achieved the maximum growth in our company sample. At V₀ = 28.4, the venture focused precisely on "AI models for autonomous vehicles"—a specific application with clear positioning. At V_T = 89.1, it had become "Synthetic data cloud for vision AI"—a broad platform serving multiple applications. The ΔV = +60.7 represents substantial broadening: from solving one problem to providing infrastructure for an entire category. The 215.9× growth demonstrates the potential of earned expansion.



## ¶76. Efficient But Saturating



Zoom Out ventures exhibit efficiency with diminishing returns. Funding reliably produces movement (dA/dE > 0), and movement improves growth—but with saturation effects. Each additional unit of broadening produces less marginal benefit than the previous unit.



| Metric | Zoom Out | Interpretation |

|--------|:--------:|:---------------|

| dG/dA | Positive but saturates | Movement helps, diminishing returns |

| dA/dE | **Positive** | Funding efficiently produces movement |



This saturation reflects natural limits to broadening. Wider scope may dilute the original value proposition, create execution complexity across multiple domains, confuse markets about the venture's core offering, and face diminishing returns as the venture approaches maximum breadth. Sky Engine's 215.9× growth represents the potential; the saturation effect explains why median Zoom Out outcomes fall below this exceptional case.



## ¶77. The Tesla Pattern



The canonical Zoom Out follows Tesla's trajectory, which Scott Stern describes as moving from "value chain" to "architecture chain." Tesla began precisely focused on high-performance electric sports cars (Roadster, 2008). It expanded to premium electric sedans (Model S, 2012), then to sustainable energy products (Model 3, Powerwall, 2017), and now positions as infrastructure for "accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy."



This fifteen-year Zoom Out trajectory illustrates earned broadening: each expansion built on demonstrated capabilities in the previous domain. Tesla could credibly claim "sustainable energy" positioning only after proving it could build electric vehicles. Sky Engine could credibly become a "synthetic data cloud" only after proving it could serve autonomous vehicle AI.



## ¶78. Foundation Requirements



Zoom Out works only with a solid foundation. Premature broadening—claiming broad scope without demonstrated capability—lacks credibility and dilutes focus. Earned broadening—proving specific capability, then extending to adjacent domains—carries credibility and builds on demonstrated strength.



The distinction is critical. "We do everything" (premature broadening) signals unfocused thinking. "We proved X, now we do X + Y + Z" (earned broadening) signals capability expansion. Investors, customers, and employees respond differently to these narratives. Our data cannot distinguish premature from earned broadening, but the success distribution suggests that earned broadening drives the Zoom Out advantage.



## ¶79. Success Rate Analysis



Zoom Out movers succeed at 18.6%, the highest among our four archetypes. This represents a 1.72× advantage over stayers (10.8%).



| Metric | Value | Interpretation |

|--------|:-----:|:---------------|

| Success rate | 18.6% | Highest among archetypes |

| vs. Stayers | 1.72× | 18.6% / 10.8% = 1.72× |

| vs. Zoom In | 1.06× | 18.6% / 17.6% = 1.06× (essentially equivalent) |

| 95% CI | [17.8%, 19.4%] | Tight precision |



The slight Zoom Out advantage (18.6% vs. 17.6%) is economically negligible and statistically marginal. The more important finding is that both directional archetypes dramatically outperform stayers, confirming the Movement Principle regardless of direction.



## ¶80. Key Insight and Transition



The Zoom Out pattern suggests that precision serves as launching pad, not destination. Starting precise proves the concept and builds credibility; zooming out captures the broader market opportunity. Maximum growth potential comes from maximum expansion—but only when earned through demonstrated initial focus.



> **Precision is a launching pad, not a destination.**



Module C has established heterogeneity in the Movement Principle: all movers outperform stayers, but the mechanisms differ across archetypes. Zoom In ventures use capital efficiently to find focus. Zoom Out ventures leverage proven capabilities for earned expansion. Horizontal movers exhibit mixed patterns reflecting the distinction between strategic pivoting and undirected thrashing.



Module T now turns to the commitment-adaptation tradeoff: why do some ventures get trapped, and how can founders maintain the adaptive capacity that drives success?
