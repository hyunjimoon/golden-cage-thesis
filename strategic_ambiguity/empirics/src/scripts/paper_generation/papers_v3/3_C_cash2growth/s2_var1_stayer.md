# Section 2: Variation 1—⚫ Stayer (Lines 56-62)

## ¶56. The Stayer Archetype

Stayers maintain their strategic positioning over time—neither zooming in toward precision nor zooming out toward breadth. By definition, their direction D ≈ 0 and their adaptability A ≈ 0. They serve as the baseline against which mover performance is benchmarked.

Stayers comprise 91% of our sample, the dominant category. Yet they show lower success at 10.8% compared to movers at 17.7%. This combination—majority prevalence with below-mover success—suggests either that staying represents a suboptimal strategy or that stayers differ systematically from movers in ways that predict lower success.

## ¶57. Company Examples

High-vagueness stayers illustrate the pattern. Rubedos began at V₀ = 81.9 and remained there (V_T = 81.9), achieving 2.6× growth—below the mover median. Surestar similarly stayed vague (V₀ = 87.9, V_T = 87.9) but achieved exceptional 26.7× growth, demonstrating that stayer success is possible though rare.

| Company | V₀ | V_T | ΔV | Growth | Description |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------:|:------------|
| **Rubedos** | 81.9 | 81.9 | 0 | 2.6× | Stayed vague |
| **Surestar** | 87.9 | 87.9 | 0 | 26.7× | Stayed vague |

## ¶58. The Stayer Problem

The data present a clear pattern: stayers represent the majority but show the worst outcomes.

| Group | Prevalence | Success Rate |
|-------|:----------:|:------------:|
| ⚫ Stayers | 91% | **10.8%** |
| All Movers | 9% | 17.7% |

Three interpretations may explain why ventures stay. First, successful lock-in: some stayers found their optimal position early, validated by immediate market acceptance—Surestar's 26.7× success exemplifies this positive frame. Second, trapped commitment: many stayers cannot adapt despite market signals, locked into initial positioning by the Fund2Cage mechanism—Rubedos's modest 2.6× may reflect constrained adaptation. Third, selection effects: stayers may differ systematically in founder quality, market dynamism, or capital availability.

## ¶59. Stayer Success by Initial Vagueness

Decomposing stayers by initial vagueness reveals that stayer underperformance occurs across the spectrum:

| Quartile | V₀ Range | Stayer Success | Movement Rate |
|----------|:--------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Q1 (precise) | 0-25 | 7.1% | 42% |
| Q2 | 25-50 | 7.5% | 35% |
| **Q3** | 50-75 | **6.6%** | 68% |
| Q4 (vague) | 75-100 | 6.8% | 55% |

Remarkably, Q3 stayers show the lowest success (6.6%) despite Q3 having the highest aggregate success. This confirms that Q3's aggregate success derives entirely from its high movement rate (68%), not from any positioning advantage. Stayer underperformance is universal across vagueness levels.

## ¶60. For Stayers: No dG/dA to Analyze

For stayers, A = 0 by definition. We cannot compute effectiveness (dG/dA) because there is no movement to analyze. Stayers serve primarily as the baseline for comparison:

| Comparison | Success Rate | vs. Stayer |
|------------|:------------:|:----------:|
| ⚫ Stayer (A=0) | 10.8% | — |
| 🟢 Horizontal | ~15% | +4.2 pp |
| 🔴 Zoom In | 17.6% | +6.8 pp |
| 🔵 Zoom Out | 18.6% | +7.8 pp |

All mover types substantially outperform stayers. The minimum mover advantage (Horizontal at +8 pp) exceeds any within-stayer variation across quartiles.

## ¶61. The Surestar Anomaly

Surestar (26.7×) demonstrates that stayers can succeed exceptionally. What explains this outlier? Possible factors include initial position optimality (market wanted exactly what they offered), execution excellence (great team and product regardless of positioning), market timing (rode a growth wave that didn't require adaptation), or measurement noise (relevant changes may not appear in our vagueness measure).

The key point: Surestar is the exception, not the rule. Median stayer growth falls far below median mover growth. Pointing to successful stayers as evidence against the Movement Principle commits the fallacy of focusing on visible survivors while ignoring the larger population of failed stayers.

## ¶62. Key Insight for Stayers

Options unexercised are options wasted. 91% of ventures stay, yet their 10.8% success lags movers at 17.7%. Even successful stayers like Surestar lag top movers like Sky Engine (215.9×). The data demonstrate that holding options without exercising them leads to underperformance. Movement—in any direction—dominates stasis.
