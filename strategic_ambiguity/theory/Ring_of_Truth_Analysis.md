| Section/Episode | 🔐 Research Question | 🔑 Key Message | 🧱 Literature Brick |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1. Perception | Why can't we trust our senses directly? | 🧍‍♀️ Senses deceive systematically; science corrects through 🧠 controlled measurement and 🌏 cross-validation | • Gibson (1979): Ecological perception<br>• Helmholtz: Unconscious inference |
| 2. Galileo | How can we trust instruments showing never-before-seen phenomena? | 🧭 New instruments gain credibility through 🗺️ convergent evidence from multiple independent observers and methods | • Kuhn (1962): Paradigm shifts<br>• Feyerabend (1975): Against Method |
| 3. Mapping & Navigation | How do we know our position in space? | 🧠 Practical performance (ships arriving safely) validates theoretical predictions; 👓 action tests truth | • Sobel (1995): Longitude<br>• Harrison's chronometer history |
| 4. Geology | How can we know about unobservable deep time? | 🤜 Imagination of alternative pasts, constrained by 🧠 present evidence that "rings true" across geological sites | • Lyell: Uniformitarianism<br>• Hutton: Deep time |
| 5. Astrophysics | How know distant star composition from only light? | 🧠 Cross-domain convergence: lab spectral lines match stellar spectra perfectly despite vast distance | • Kirchhoff & Bunsen: Spectroscopy<br>• Fraunhofer lines |
| 6. Quantum Mechanics | How embrace fundamental uncertainty as knowledge? | 🗺️ Quantum "truth" isn't deterministic but 🌏 probabilistic patterns that "ring" across all experiments | • Heisenberg: Uncertainty principle<br>• Bohr: Complementarity |

## 🗄️3: Practical Implications

| Domain | Implication | Example Application |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Investor Due Diligence** | Require convergent evidence across technology, market, and team claims | "Does the founding team's track record 'ring' with their ambitious projections?" |
| **Customer Trust Building** | Promises that "ring" = consistency between words and demonstrated actions | Tesla's "200+ mile range" rings true because cars actually achieve it |
| **Pivot Justification** | New direction must still "ring" with accumulated evidence base | Slack pivoted from gaming to enterprise, but collaboration DNA remained consistent |
| **Scientific Communication** | Complex truths need multiple independent demonstrations | Morrison's TV demonstrations made abstract physics viscerally convincing |
| **Educational Design** | "Show, don't just tell" - hands-on evidence trumps abstract explanation | Interactive museum exhibits vs. textbook descriptions |

## 🔗 Connection to Your Research

### Epistemological Mirror

| Ring of Truth (Morrison) | How We Know What Not To Think (Phillips) |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| "How do we KNOW?" | "How do we NOT think?" |
| Knowledge Acquisition | Possibility Filtering |
| 🧠 Evidence → Theory → Truth | 🧭 Sample → Evaluate → Decide |
| Convergent confirmation | Efficient consideration |
| Building certainty | Managing attention |

### Strategic Ambiguity Integration

**Key Insight**: τ(precision)가 낮더라도, 다중 이해관계자의 해석이 **수렴**하면 "Ring of Truth"가 형성된다.

```
Traditional View:          Morrison-Informed View:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
High τ → Trust             Low τ + Convergence → Trust
(specific = credible)      (coherent interpretations = credible)

Better Place:              Tesla:
"Exactly 5 minutes"        "200+ mile range"
     │                          │
     ▼                          ▼
No convergence              Convergent evidence
(battery tech, infra,       (battery tech ✓, charging ✓,
customer behavior           customer demand ✓)
all pointed different
directions)
     │                          │
     ▼                          ▼
  NO RING                    RINGS TRUE
  (Failure)                  (Success)
```

### Testable Hypotheses

**HE (Evidence Convergence)**:
> Ventures whose promises show evidence convergence across technology, market, and team dimensions will receive higher funding than those with single-dimension evidence, controlling for promise specificity (τ).

**HL (Long-term Coherence)**:
> Ventures that maintain "ring" coherence through pivots (new direction consistent with accumulated evidence) will have higher survival rates than those with discontinuous pivots.

## 🎯 For Your Paper: Application Guide

### Direct Application

| Morrison Concept | Your Framework Translation | Measurement Approach |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| "Ring of Truth" | Multi-stakeholder interpretation convergence | Survey different stakeholder interpretations; measure variance |
| Evidence convergence | Promise-evidence alignment | Count independent evidence lines supporting core promise |
| Cross-domain consistency | Tech-Market-Team alignment | Score consistency across three domains |
| Practical performance | Milestone achievement | Track promise vs. delivery match rate |

### Writing Hook

> "Morrison (1987) argues that scientific truths 'ring' when multiple independent methods converge on the same conclusion. We extend this epistemological insight to entrepreneurial promises: strategic ambiguity succeeds not by avoiding specificity, but by enabling **convergent interpretations** across diverse stakeholders—each hearing a different note, yet all recognizing the same melody."
