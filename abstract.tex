Early funding hurts startups. Analyzing 168,011 ventures, I find that early-stage capital correlates \emph{negatively} with later success ($\rho = -0.04$, $p < 0.001$). Capital-intensive sectors suffer most: Hardware ($\rho = -0.11$) and Transportation ($\rho = -0.10$) show the steepest penalties.

Why would resources hurt? Founders who seek capital must commit to specific strategies. Investors who fund share those beliefs; skeptics never join. Extending Van den Steen's sorting equilibrium from employee-manager matching to investor-founder contexts, I show how funding homogenizes governance. When markets shift, no board member advocates for change. I call this structural trap the \emph{golden cage}.

To measure the cage, I develop a text-based \textbf{Strategic Breadth ($B$)} metric from company descriptions. The paradox decomposes into two forces:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \cage{Commitment Cage:} Funding suppresses repositioning ($\rho = -0.133$, $p < 0.001$).
    \item \flex{Flexibility Flex:} Repositioning predicts survival---Movers outperform Stayers by 2.60$\times$ (17.6\% vs.\ 6.7\%).
\end{enumerate}
Together: $dG/dE = (dG/dR) \times (dR/dE) = (+) \times (-) = (-)$. Funding blocks the very adaptation that uncertain markets demand.

Industry patterns reveal boundary conditions. The cage binds tightest where switching costs are high (Hardware, Transportation). It releases where no dominant design exists---Quantum Computing shows a \emph{positive} funding-growth correlation ($\rho = +0.10$).

Founders can escape the cage through three architectural levers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item \emph{Scope}: Commit to thesis (vision), not architecture (solution)---attract diverse believers who agree on \emph{why} but differ on \emph{how}.
    \item \emph{Synchronization}: Scale capabilities with market demand---diagnose binding constraints before locking in the wrong dimension.
    \item \emph{Sequencing}: Climb the funding ladder (grants $\rightarrow$ matching capital $\rightarrow$ thesis-driven VC)---delay governance homogenization until signals clarify.
\end{enumerate}

This thesis contributes a governance-based theory of venture rigidity and prescribes design principles that preserve flexibility within commitment structures.
